  abstract = {Karez system is considered as the global human heritage since it is not only a traditional water supply system of exploiting groundwater, but also it reflects the culture, socio-economy, and history of the ancient civilizations that had utilized them for thousands of years in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. However, with the explosive population growth and rapid development of pumping technology in the last century, the karezes dried up or were abandoned as pumping wells lower the groundwater table. This poses a dilemma to policy makers whether to facilitate large-scale utilization of pumping well technology over karez system and treat karez as a cultural heritage which is non-functional for food production, or to keep using and preserving the karez system as a sustainable way of groundwater management as part of the integrated water supply systems in the arid regions. In this paper, we reviewed the historical, socio-economic, and cultural importance of karezes in the arid regions. We also discussed the distribution of karezes in the world, their unique geographical characteristics, technological advantages and limitations. We observed that the karez system is not only economically robust over the long term, but also a viable water supply technique for irrigation and domestic uses. The karezes should be protected as indigenous human heritage, and at the same time, they can be utilized as a sustainable way of water resources management in the arid regions to enhance water resiliency under changing environment.},

French experts on the Orient imagined oppressed natives awaiting their liberation and imagined themselves as competent liberators and managers of resources. In reality, the French faced manipulative natives and a holy war, and they had to reinstall the very ancient régime they came to depose. The French brought environmental destruction to Upper Egypt with a massive wave of plague.},

Analogies between these theoretical perspectives and the two visual systems involved in visual perception (the dorsal and ventral stream) suggest that the literature on visual information processing can be organized around two types of processes: object processing and spatial processing. Object processing involves the identification and recognition of stimuli in the environment and is shaped by existing concepts and associations in memory. It is associated with the processing of properties of objects such as color, size, shape, and pictorial details that are considered in this review. Spatial processing involves the perception of location, movement, spatial relations, and transformation of objects and other stimuli. Imagery-based processes that are used to transform marketing stimuli in order to simulate various possibilities are reviewed in this section along with individual differences in spatial and visual abilities.},

  abstract = {[Judaism, Christianity, and Islam have long been engaged in a tripartite polemical and intellectual tradition. An early modern example of this interaction appears in a five-page manuscript collection of information about Islam compiled by the Venetian rabbi Leon Modena (1571—1648). He relied on the 1547 Italian edition of the Qur'an published by Andrea Arrivabene. It had its roots in Christian versions of the Qur'an and supplementary material about Islam. Christians used classical Islamic commentaries to prepare comprehensible and nuanced versions of the Qur'an, and around the text they also included hostile notes, introductions, and appendices. Modena processed the material following his Christian predecessors by culling excerpts, paraphrasing, and using some of his own Jewish vocabulary. He did not distinguish whether material was from the accompanying corpus or the Qur'an. Modena presents Islam in a positive light, very close to rabbinic Jewish practice, and he uses information about Islam, provided by Christian polemicists against Islam, against Christianity. As cultural mediators draw closer to other cultures, the ensuing distancing from their own culture leaves them with deeper insight about it or a greater critical vantage point. As a result, Arrivabene, Modena, and others in this textual tradition ran into trouble with their own religious authorities. Jews, Christians, and Muslims who draw close to each other today still face some of the same challenges.]},

  abstract = {One of the most controversial episodes in the life of the Prophet Muhammad concerns an incident in which he allegedly mistook words suggested by Satan as divine revelation. Known as the Satanic verses, these praises to the pagan deities contradict the Islamic belief that Allah is one and absolute. Muslims today--of all sects--deny that the incident of the Satanic verses took place. But as Shahab Ahmed explains, Muslims did not always hold this view. Before Orthodoxy wrestles with the question of how religions establish truth--especially religions such as Islam that lack a centralized authority to codify beliefs. Taking the now universally rejected incident of the Satanic verses as a case study in the formation of Islamic orthodoxy, Ahmed shows that early Muslims, circa 632 to 800 CE, held the exact opposite belief. For them, the Satanic verses were an established fact in the history of the Prophet. Ahmed offers a detailed account of the attitudes of Muslims to the Satanic verses in the first two centuries of Islam and traces the chains of transmission in the historical reports known as riwāyah. Touching directly on the nature of Muhammad's prophetic visions, the interpretation of the Satanic verses incident is a question of profound importance in Islam, one that plays a role in defining the limits of what Muslims may legitimately say and do--issues crucial to understanding the contemporary Islamic world.--},

The imamate of Tāhart even stood, in the posthumous memory of the school, as an ideal counter-model of the caliphate. In fact, during the 8th and 9th centuries western Ibāḍism remained under the influence of its eastern strongholds, in particular Baṣra where the sectarian elite was well integrated into ʿAbbāsid culture. Intense scholarly exchange linked west and east thanks to intermediary meeting points like Mecca and Fusṭāṭ. The Ibāḍī political opposition of ‘Berber’ and ‘Arab’ ethnicity certainly worked against the imperial discourse, but the Persian shuʿūbiyya shaped it. The Rustamid imamate came to be the symbol of a Persian state in a Berber milieu and its capital and state apparatus underwent a gradual orientalization. Trade also played a key role in connecting the Ibāḍī network with the empire. Baṣra was a notorious emporium and Ibāḍī merchants circulated widely between the ʿAbbāsid realm and its western fringes.

They claim that French orientalists in the early twentieth century created an ideal type of the Islamic city as contrasted with its Western counterpart in order to support the assumptions of orientalist discourse. The first part of the article challenges this assumption by showing that the French orientalists did not in fact posit an Islamic city type. The second part offers an alternative explanation for the genesis of the concept by tracing it to the work of American anthropologists in the 1950s.},

The theory provides the conceptual underpinnings for a new approach which moves away from expert defined standardised metadata to a user driven approach with users as metadata co-creators. Moving away from definitive, authoritative, metadata to a system that reflects the diversity of users' terminologies, it changes the current focus on metadata simplicity and efficiency to one of metadata enriching, which is a continuous and evolving process of data linking. From predefined description to information conceptualised, contextualised and filtered at the point of delivery. By presenting this shift, this book provides a coherent structure in which future technological developments can be considered. * Metadata is valuable when continuously enriched by experts and users* Metadata enriching results from ubiquitous linking * Metadata is a resource that should be linked openly* The power of metadata is unlocked when enriched metadata is filtered for users individually},

This book will be essential reading for advanced students and academics of Religious studies, Arabic and Islamic studies and those interested in the work of Derrida and Ibn 'Arabi.},

Oaths are multifaceted, rich expressions, in which a single oath contains a line of meaning and a variety of aspects. This study proposes a new stylometric model for detecting apparent and narrative oaths. Toward this end, two types of application-specific features from a stylometric perspective—structural and content-specific features—were examined. The stylometric features were extracted, and a Bayesian network was constructed to model such features. The stylometric model of oaths was then evaluated through a series of machine-learning experiments using various classifiers: the Bayesian network, a decision tree, instance-based learning, and a neural network. These classification experiments focused on applying stylometric features in apparent and narrative oaths. The experiments covered two datasets: the entire Quran and the smaller dataset of Juz ’ ‘ Amma . The results led to two main conclusions. First, stylometric application-specific features are best used in their entirety—both structural-based and content-specific—rather than as two separate entities. Second, applying stylometric features was more significant in Juz ’ ‘ Amma , in which 40\% of its surahs (chapters) contain oath statements. Finally, the stylometric model was extended for oath styles detection using three additional stylometric features—syntactic, character, and lexical, and it was analyzed using statistical approach.},

This article examines the reality of destitute Jews living in Egypt and Syria under the Ayyubid regime in order to determine which of the two conflicting Shāfiʿī rulings was applied in practice. Drawing on Geniza documents and literary sources, I argue that in the Ayyubid period no exemptions were offered to the poor whatsoever. This taxation policy, in my view, may reflect not an arbitrary choice made by local Ayyubid tax officials, but a conscious decision made by the Ayyubid rulers and the leading contemporary Shāfiʿī scholars. The Ayyubids most likely appealed to the Shāfiʿī religious authorities, pressing them to adopt the more stringent opinion, which would allow authorities to refrain from exempting the poor.},

One salient theme in the military, political and social history of the eastern Islamic world of the late Middle Ages and early modern period is the alteration and even tension between nomadic and standing armies. With the advent of the Mongol period in Iran, one may encounter an army of Inner Asian origin, with both similarities and differences between it and the original Turcoman army of the Saljuqs. The Mongols introduced a larger scale of armies and fighting, and this in turn influenced at least some of their enemies who were one of their main adversaries in the Middle East in the period after 1260. The demands of the Mongol administration were quite onerous, and contributed in many places to a decline in the economy, agricultural and urban.},

  abstract = {Stemmatology, or the reconstruction of the transmission history of texts, is a field that stands particularly to gain from digital methods. Many scholars already take stemmatic approaches that rely heavily on computational analysis of the collated text (e.g. Robinson and O’Hara 1996; Salemans 2000; Heikkilä 2005; Windram et al. 2008 among many others). Although there is great value in computationally assisted stemmatology, providing as it does a reproducible result and allowing access to the relevant methodological process in related fields such as evolutionary biology, computational stemmatics is not without its critics. The current state-of-the-art effectively forces scholars to choose between a preconceived judgment of the significance of textual differences (the Lachmannian or neo-Lachmannian approach, and the weighted phylogenetic approach) or to make no judgment at all (the unweighted phylogenetic approach). Some basis for judgment of the significance of variation is sorely needed for medieval text criticism in particular. By this, we mean that there is a need for a statistical empirical profile of the text-genealogical significance of the different sorts of variation in different sorts of medieval texts. The rules that apply to copies of Greek and Latin classics may not apply to copies of medieval Dutch story collections; the practices of copying authoritative texts such as the Bible will most likely have been different from the practices of copying the Lives of local saints and other commonly adapted texts. It is nevertheless imperative that we have a consistent, flexible, and analytically tractable model for capturing these phenomena of transmission. In this article, we present a computational model that captures most of the phenomena of text variation, and a method for analysis of one or more stemma hypotheses against the variation model. We apply this method to three ‘artificial traditions’ (i.e. texts copied under laboratory conditions by scholars to study the properties of text variation) and four genuine medieval traditions whose transmission history is known or deduced in varying degrees. Although our findings are necessarily limited by the small number of texts at our disposal, we demonstrate here some of the wide variety of calculations that can be made using our model. Certain of our results call sharply into question the utility of excluding ‘trivial’ variation such as orthographic and spelling changes from stemmatic analysis.},

  abstract = {The frequencies of individual words have been the mainstay of computer-assisted authorial attribution over the past three decades. The usefulness of this sort of data is attested in many benchmark trials and in numerous studies of particular authorship problems. It is sometimes argued, however, that since language as spoken or written falls into word sequences, on the ‘idiom principle’, and since language is characteristically produced in the brain in chunks, not in individual words, n-grams with n higher than 1 are superior to individual words as a source of authorship markers. In this article, we test the usefulness of word n-grams for authorship attribution by asking how many good-quality authorship markers are yielded by n-grams of various types, namely 1-grams, 2-grams, 3-grams, 4-grams, and 5-grams. We use two ways of formulating the n-grams, two corpora of texts, and two methods for finding and assessing markers. We find that when using methods based on regularly occurring markers, and drawing on all the available vocabulary, 1-grams perform best. With methods based on rare markers, and all the available vocabulary, strict 3-gram sequences perform best. If we restrict ourselves to a defined word-list of function-words to form n-grams, 2-grams offer a striking improvement on 1-grams.},

  location = {{London}},
  abstract = {Mapping the Middle East explores the many perspectives from which people have visualized the vast area lying between the Atlantic Ocean and the Oxus and Indus river valleys over the past millennium. By analysing maps produced from the eleventh century on, Zayde Antrim emphasizes the deep roots of mapping in a world region too often considered unexamined and unchanging before the modern period. Indeed, maps from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, coinciding with the eras of European colonialism and the rise of the nation-state, have obscured this deeper past and constrained future possibilities. Mapping the Middle East is organized chronologically to contextualize and interpret compelling maps from each period. Chapters address the medieval `Realm of Islam', the sixteenth- to eighteenth-century Ottoman Empire, French and British colonial mapping over the long nineteenth century, national mapping traditions in modern Turkey, Iran and Israel/Palestine, and alternative geographies in twentieth- and twenty-first-century maps.

  abstract = {"Provocative yet sober, Digital Critical Editions examines how transitioning from print to a digital milieu deeply affects how scholars deal with the work of editing critical texts. On one hand, forces like changing technology and evolving reader expectations lead to the development of specific editorial products, while on the other hand, they threaten traditional forms of knowledge and methods of textual scholarship. Using the experiences of philologists, text critics, text encoders, scientific editors, and media analysts, Digital Critical Editions ranges from philology in ancient Alexandria to the vision of user-supported online critical editing, from peer-directed texts distributed to a few to community-edited products shaped by the many. The authors discuss the production and accessibility of documents, the emergence of tools used in scholarly work, new editing regimes, and how the readers' expectations evolve as they navigate digital texts. The goal: exploring questions such as, What kind of text is produced? Why is it produced in this particular way? Digital Critical Editions provides digital editors, researchers, readers, and technological actors with insights for addressing disruptions that arise from the clash of traditional and digital cultures, while also offering a practical roadmap for processing traditional texts and collections with today's state-of-the-art editing and research techniques thus addressing readers' new emerging reading habits" "Critical editions are going on-line, but not without intense controversy. Digital Critical Editions investigates how the transition from the print-based humanities to various forms of digital presentations affects not only the way scholarly editors deal with the practicalities of critical text editing, but also, in a deeper way, various conceptions about the nature of texts and their transmission. To explore the transition fully, it combines the experience of philologists, text critics, text encoders, scientific editors, and analysts of the digital turn, to set the searchlight on the future of philology's crown jewel - scholarly editing. It tackles a wide range of issues, offering the reader a deep view of editorial traditions and practices, from ancient Alexandrian philology to cutting-edge issues in text mark-up, from the Lachmannian revolution in textual criticism to visions about user-supported online critical editing, and from narrowly distributed peer-directed products to community-oriented broad products. The book bridges the expertise of philologists and new kinds of reading practices in cyberspace. It offers digital editors and prospective digital editors a sober description of state-of-the-art techniques and standards of text encoding grammars and transformation mechanisms. It does not dwell on arcane theoretical issues, nor on highly technical text mark-up considerations but instead attempts to extend the benefits already achieved to new kinds of texts and collections"},

By operating on generic object types, these packages unite research innovations in corpus linguistics, natural language processing, machine learning, statistics, and digital humanities. We begin by extrapolating on the theoretical benefits of R as an elaborate gluing language for bringing together several areas of expertise and compare it to linguistic concordancers and other tool-based approaches to text analysis in the digital humanities. We then showcase the practical benefits of an ecosystem by illustrating how R packages have been integrated into a digital humanities project. Throughout, the focus is on moving beyond the bag-of-words, lexical frequency model by incorporating linguistically-driven analyses in research.},

As a result, I offer a fresh look at monasticism as an organic component of the rural landscape and at the rural monk as a domestic villager rather than a revered role model for society.},

It investigates how cultures remember, arguing that human memory exists and is communicated in two ways, namely inter-human interaction and in external systems of notation, such as writing, which can span generations. Dr. Assmann defines two theoretical concepts of cultural memory, differentiating between the long-term memory of societies, which can span up to 3,000 years, and communicative memory, which is typically restricted to 80-100 years. He applies this theoretical framework to case studies of four specific cultures, illustrating the function contexts and specific achievements, including the state, international law, religion, and science. Ultimately, his research demonstrates that memory is not simply a means of retaining information, but rather a force that can shape cultural identity and allow cultures to respond creatively to both daily challenges and catastrophic changes"--},

However, there is still no agreement on which methods are best suited for particular settings and, moreover, there is no reliable comparison of already developed methods. We believe that one of the main reasons is the lack of state-of-the-art method implementations, which are usually non-trivial to recreate—mostly, in terms of software engineering efforts. In order to address these issues, we present ATR4S, an open-source software written in Scala that comprises 13 state-of-the-art methods for automatic terminology recognition (ATR) and implements the whole pipeline from text document preprocessing, to term candidates collection, term candidate scoring, and finally, term candidate ranking. It is highly scalable, modular and configurable tool with support of automatic caching. We also compare 13 state-of-the-art methods on 7 open datasets by average precision and processing time. Experimental comparison reveals that no single method demonstrates best average precision for all datasets and that other available tools for ATR do not contain the best methods.},

By examining these catalogs in terms of the wider historical significance of their materiality, specifically their organization, layout, typography and illustrations, in this essay I show how these booklets promoted the \textsc{AMP} and its mission’s entangled messages in an increasingly competitive publishing industry. On the one hand, the catalogs highlighted the \textsc{AMP}’s ‘western’ qualifications and strove to engage local readers’ interests in ‘modern’ culture, science and technology. On the other hand, these works marketed the mission’s universalist evangelical views. Thus, in this study I show how such ephemeral publications, when studied for their dynamic content, make evident nineteenth-century Arabic print commerce at work and also illustrate early examples of nascent advertising practices.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Careful evaluation shows that some of the classifiers we define are, indeed, highly accurate, and scale up nicely to domains that they were not trained on. In addition, analysis of the best features provides insight into the morphological properties of translated texts.},

  abstract = {The spread of foreign languages, especially French, under European colonial rule inspired certain Arabic writers and scholars in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century to look at ways to develop the Arabic language. This happened because they felt that foreign languages had started to overtake Arabic because they were easier to read (ZAKĪ 1901: 2). In this paper, I will discuss the use of punctuation marks in Arabic texts since the mid-nineteenth century as an example of the evolution of Arabic writing due to European influence. I will explain the reasons why punctuation marks were integrated into Arabic texts, quoting Arabic writers and scholars from the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. These include Zaynab Fawwāz, the first writer to address the issue of punctuation marks in Arabic writings (FAWWĀZ 2007: 105-107), and ʾAḥmad Zakī who officially integrated punctuation into the Arabic language (ZAKĪ 1912). I will also explain the opposition that came from conservative scholars who were reluctant to change any aspect of Arabic writing. This is because they believed in the sanctity of Arabic as it is the language of the Qurʾān and it represents Arabic identity. Therefore, one should avoid any “borrowing” from colonial languages in order to preserve Arabic identity (MEYNET 1971: 94).Keywords: Punctuation, Arabic writing, ʾAḥmad Zakī, printing, Arabic Renaissance / an-Nahḍa al-ʿarabiyya, transmission of knowledge},

The proposed method uses the distributional semantics to build the word-context matrix representing the distribution of words across contexts and to transform the text into a vector space model (VSM) representation based on word semantic similarity. The linguistic features of the Arabic language, in addition to the semantic information extracted from different lexical-semantic resources such as Arabic WordNet and named entities’ gazetteers are used to improve the text representation and to create word clusters of similar and related words. Distributional similarity measures have been used to capture the words’ semantic similarity and to create clusters of similar words. The conducted experiments have shown that the proposed method significantly reduces the size of text representation by about 27 \% compared with the stem-based VSM and by about 50 \% compared with the traditional bag-of-words model. Their results have shown that the amount of dimension reduction depends on the size and shape of the windows of analysis as well as on the content of the text.},

This article examines a small section of this scene: the growth, spreading and changing characteristics of book dealerships and bookshops in the Arab Ottoman provinces during the formative half-century prior to World War I. Exploring this mechanism casts light on the nature and pace of printing assimilation in the region, projecting it as a rather dramatic makeover.]},

We still know surprisingly little about premodern learned women, particularly from the eastern Iranian world. This article describes one female mystic, Umm ʿAlī, who flourished in ninth-century Balkh and has so far eluded modern scholarship. A historiographical study of her provides insight into how the representations of mystical women changed over time. From the earlier sources, we learn that Umm ʿAlī applied creative and interesting strategies that provided her access to the highest sources of learning. Umm ʿAlī’s case also allows for some tentative conclusions on the importance of pedigree, and the practice of strategic marriages that connect local power-holders with the ʿulamāʾ.},

  abstract = {The Arab grammarians differentiate between the ziyāda (augment) that introduces~an element of meaning and the ziyāda that appends (yulḥiq) one~morphological form to another. Having realized the potential of the concept~of ilḥāq (appending) as an analytical tool in morphology, the grammarians~divided appended words into several types according to the number of the~radicals in their roots and the type of ziyāda that is involved, and tried to~justify forms and patterns with reference to a set of detailed rules which~they elaborately describe. This paper deals with the issues the grammarians~tackle in their study of ilḥāq, such as its purpose, the possibility of analogically~extending its examples, and the inapplicability of idġām (gemination)~to its patterns. It also examines how the grammarians use ilḥāq to reduce~considerably the number of morphological patterns that form a closed~system, to explain away anomalous and rare patterns, and thus to limit~deviation from the norm (qiyās) and to test the validity of a host of morphological~issues.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that processing information in one sensory modality can either be enhanced or attenuated by concurrent stimulation of another modality. Here, we reconcile these apparently contradictory results by showing that the sign of cross-modal interactions depends on whether the content of two modalities is associated or not. When concurrently presented auditory and visual stimuli are paired by chance, cue-induced preparatory neural activity is strongly enhanced in the task-relevant sensory system and suppressed in the irrelevant system. Conversely, when information in the two modalities is reliably associated, activity is enhanced in both systems regardless of which modality is task relevant. Our findings illustrate an ecologically optimal flexibility of the neural mechanisms that govern multisensory processing: facilitation occurs when integration is expected, and suppression occurs when distraction is expected. Because thalamic structures were more active when the senses needed to operate separately, we propose them to serve gatekeeper functions in early cross-modal interactions.},

Yet it has rarely been considered by social or cultural anthropologists, who represent the largest subfield of the discipline. In this powerful study Alan Barnard aims to bridge this gap. Barnard argues that social anthropological theory has much to contribute to our understanding of human evolution, including changes in technology, subsistence and exchange, family and kinship, as well as to the study of language, art, ritual and belief. This book places social anthropology in the context of a widely-conceived constellation of anthropological sciences. It incorporates recent findings in many fields, including primate studies, archaeology, linguistics and human genetics. In clear, accessible style Barnard addresses the fundamental questions surrounding the evolution of human society and the prehistory of culture, suggesting a new direction for social anthropology that will open up debate across the discipline as a whole"--},

  abstract = {We present the methodological and technical process we adopted to develop DanteSources, a Web application that allows free access to the knowledge about Dante Alighieri’s primary sources, i.e. the works of other authors that Dante cites in his texts. Up to now, this knowledge has been collected in many paper books, making it difficult for the scholars to retrieve it and to produce a complete overview of these data. Using Semantic Web technologies, we developed an ontology expressed in the Resource Description Framework Schema vocabulary providing the terms to represent this knowledge in a machine-readable form. A semi-automatic tool helps the scholars to populate the ontology with the data included in authoritative paper commentaries to Dante’s works. Then, the tool automatically saves the resulting Resource Description Framework graph in a triple store. On top of this graph, we developed DanteSources, a Web application that allows users to extract and display the information stored in the knowledge base in the form of charts and tables. Finally, we report the results of a survey to collect suggestions from end-users on their interactions with DanteSources. The methodology and the tools we developed are easily reusable, e.g. to represent the knowledge about primary sources of other authors of the Italian and the international literature.},

  abstract = {The greatest impact of Islam on history has been cultural yet, this aspect of Islamic history has been neglected in comparison to political and judicial history. V.V. Bartold, the Russian historian was one of the first scholars to project Muslim culture. In this world, Bartold gave primacy to clarity and the organization of knowledge. He posits the position of Islam in world history to the position of Christianity as a cultural force in both the Roman and the eastern worlds. Bartold's Russian vantage made him a specialist on Islam in Central Asia; hence Ajam culture, Persian in the first instance, and Turco-Mongol in the second, find their proper place, with the result that the Abbasid and post-Abbasid Muslim cultures find their proper place. The Mongol invasion is not treated merely as destruction and disruption of Muslim culture, but also as a factor which affected late medieval culture. Most of the great exponents of Muslim culture, Ibn Khaldun and Avicenna are covered. Bartold concludes with remarking on the effect on his native Russia of the passing of cultural leadership from the East to the West. This monograph is remarkable for retaining its relevance and validity after almost a whole century and a host of intervening specialised works in the intervening period. This work was translated four years after the author's death by Shahid Suhrawardy, an eminent scholar in his own right, and the Foreword has been written by Sir Hassan Suhrawardy, then Vice-Chancellor of the Calcutta University.},

It shows that from the late Sasanian period on, and accelerating in the early Islamic period, there was a relatively unrestricted functioning of markets for goods, labour, and capital. This stimulated market exchange, associated with growing monetization of the economy, especially in the towns, but also in the countryside, even though coercion remained more pronounced there. We hypothesize that these developments brought economic dynamism but simultaneously increased inequality and furthered the rise of new, powerful elite groups, causing the decline of the same markets.},

Two social housing projects in İzmir are chosen as case studies as an initial step to be developed toward a potentially international digital platform. The theoretical premises of the project are based on the renowned cultural theorist Henri Lefebvre’s Spatial Triad, which distinguishes between representations of space, representational spaces or spaces of representation, and spatial practices. Following this framework, the collected data are organized in three sections, which are reflected in the digital interface. These are respectively titled, ‘implementations’, which contains architectural drawings and visual recordings of interviews with the chief architect of the projects; ‘perceptions’, which includes related texts that are scanned from Web sites, newspapers, journals, and conference proceedings; and ‘lived experiences’, which contains photographs and visual records of on-site interviews with the users of the two housing estates. Users of the digital interface are enabled access to data in each category by means of choosing one of eighty-three related keywords. The latter are derived from the digital analyses of discursive material. By enabling the comparison of the sections of spatial data for each settlement and between the two settlements, the digital platform has the potential to inform decision-making processes in future social housing projects.},

Quanzhou/Zaitun bore the key hallmarks of Islamic presence in China between the eighth and thirteenth centuries. The Mongols populated their newly built observatory in Khanbaliq with astronomers brought in from the Islamic world, where astronomy and mathematics were the most advanced in the world. The Nanjing phase, which corresponds quite closely to the rise of the Ming dynasty in the fourteenth century, is a turning point in the Chinese Muslim history. Whereas the Nanjing phase of Chinese Islamic history was mostly cultural in nature, the final phase of Lanzhou and Xinjiang is marked by a mixture of cultural shifts, military activity and violence.},

The Sanhaja Almoravids emerged from the Sahara in the 1050s to conquer vast territories and halt the Christian advance in Iberia. They were replaced a century later by their rivals, the Almohads, supported by the Masmuda Berbers of the High Atlas. Although both have often been seen as uncouth, religiously intolerant tribesmen who undermined the high culture of al-Andalus, this book argues that the eleventh to thirteenth centuries were crucial to the Islamisation of the Maghrib, its integration into the Islamic cultural sphere, and its emergence as a key player in the western Mediterranean, and that much of this was due to these oft-neglected Berber empires},

  abstract = {This paper explores the image of the ʿAbbasid caliphate in the Islamic west from the Umayyad era until the rise of the Almoravids, the first major Maghribī dynasty to give their allegiance to the ʿAbbasids. Despite the Umayyads' studied refusal to acknowledge the ʿAbbasids as true caliphs, many scholars have mentioned the introduction of courtly norms, poetic forms, and scientific knowledge from Iraq from the early ninth century CE onwards and the appearance of artefacts of supposed ʿAbbasid provenance in Umayyad Cordoba. One of the most renowned of these was the necklace of al-Shifāʾ, one of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān II's concubines, which Ibn Ḥayyān describes as an ʿAbbasid treasure lost during the great civil war between al-Amīn and al-Maʾmūn. One theory is that this real or symbolic acquisition of eastern items indicated the ʿAbbasidisation of the Umayyad regime. This paper, however, argues that the borrowing that occurred was often rather haphazard and that while the east certainly could represent wealth, glamour and high culture, the Umayyads were still at pains to delegitimise the ʿAbbasids as a dynasty and vaunt their own religio-political credentials. Moreover, the term ʿAbbasidisation is too broad and subsumes a range of different processes of exchange taking place in Fusṭāṭ, Medina, Baghdad and Cordoba itself, some conscious and some less so. A similar pattern appears in relation to Almoravid relations with the ʿAbbasids: while the Almoravids recognised rather than rejected ʿAbbasid sovereignty, they also did so to enhance their own domestic legitimacy in the Islamic west and the actual contacts they had with Baghdad were similarly serendipitous rather than planned. Both these examples encourage us to think more deeply about the nature of centre-periphery relations in medieval Islam, and give texture to our understanding of how contacts were made and sustained across the vast domains of the Dār al-Islām.},

  abstract = {When a shift in writing style is noticed in a document, doubts arise about its originality. Based on this clue to plagiarism, the intrinsic approach to plagiarism detection identifies the stolen passages by analysing the writing style of the suspicious document without comparing it to textual resources that may serve as sources for the plagiarist. Character n-grams are recognised as a successful approach to modelling text for writing style analysis. Although prior studies have investigated the best practice of using character n-grams in authorship attribution and other problems, there is still a need for such investigations in the context of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Moreover, it has been assumed in previous works that the ways of using character n-grams in authorship attribution remain the same for intrinsic plagiarism detection. In this paper, we study the effect of character n-grams frequency and length on the performance of intrinsic plagiarism detection. Our experiments utilise two state-of-the-art methods and five large document collections of PAN labs written in English and Arabic. We demonstrate empirically that the low- and the high-frequency n-grams are not equally relevant for intrinsic plagiarism detection, but their performance depends on the way they are exploited.},

There were some in our own corner of the profession blazing new methodological trails—Clifford Geertz, for example, who, though not a historian, had much to say to historians, and whose books were read eagerly by historians, and not just in Middle Eastern history; or Fedwa Malti-Douglas, as much at home in feminist literary theory as in medieval Arabic literature. But many graduate students in Middle Eastern history felt a bit underrepresented on the cutting edge of historical thought and practice.},

By means of resampling procedures, the present study shows that when used in this context, the chi-squared test produces far too many significant results, even in its modified version.

The paper first surveys the methodological characteristics of corpus-driven research and then contrasts the linguistic characteristics of two types of multi-word sequences: ‘multi-word lexical collocations’ (combinations of content words) versus ‘multi-word formulaic sequences’ (incorporating both function words and content words). 	Building on this background, the primary focus of the paper is an empirical investigation of the ‘patterns’ represented by multi-word formulaic sequences. It turns out that the multi-word patterns typical of speech are fundamentally different from those typical of academic writing: patterns in conversation tend to be fixed sequences (including both function words and content words). In contrast, most patterns in academic writing are formulaic frames consisting of invariable function words with an intervening variable slot that is filled by content words.},

  abstract = {Studies of the memory capabilities of nonhuman primates have consistently revealed a relative weakness for auditory compared to visual or tactile stimuli: extensive training is required to learn auditory memory tasks, and subjects are only capable of retaining acoustic information for a brief period of time. Whether a parallel deficit exists in human auditory memory remains an outstanding question. In the current study, a short-term memory paradigm was used to test human subjects’ retention of simple auditory, visual, and tactile stimuli that were carefully equated in terms of discriminability, stimulus exposure time, and temporal dynamics. Mean accuracy did not differ significantly among sensory modalities at very short retention intervals (1–4 s). However, at longer retention intervals (8–32 s), accuracy for auditory stimuli fell substantially below that observed for visual and tactile stimuli. In the interest of extending the ecological validity of these findings, a second experiment tested recognition memory for complex, naturalistic stimuli that would likely be encountered in everyday life. Subjects were able to identify all stimuli when retention was not required, however, recognition accuracy following a delay period was again inferior for auditory compared to visual and tactile stimuli. Thus, the outcomes of both experiments provide a human parallel to the pattern of results observed in nonhuman primates. The results are interpreted in light of neuropsychological data from nonhuman primates, which suggest a difference in the degree to which auditory, visual, and tactile memory are mediated by the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices.},

This change was more than a convenience. It was transformative. Database represents a new form of textuality, and scholars have come to rely on database's affordances to develop new ways of reading. In addition to content analysis of claims made about database in various fora, modest bibliometric analysis of two journals (American Literature and English Literary History) suggests trends: more and more diverse primary texts are being read and cited. Interviews with authors of journal articles and journal editors are used to characterize how the databases are used and the effect on scholarship.},

We argue that the relationship between quantitative methods and qualitative interpretation can be reframed by investigating the long history of machine learning procedures and their historical antecedents. The new method of visualization presented by the Networked Corpus enables users to compare the results of topic models with earlier methods of topical representation such as the 18th-century subject index. Although the article provides a brief description of the tool, the primary focus is to describe an argument for this kind of comparative analysis between topic models and older genres that perform similar tasks. Such comparative analysis provides a new method for developing conceptual histories of the categories of meaning on which the topic model and the index depend. These devices are linked by a shared attempt to represent what a text is ‘about’, but the concept of ‘aboutness’ has evolved over time. The Networked Corpus enables researchers to discover congruities and contradictions in how topic models and indexes represent texts in order to examine what kinds of information each historically situated device prioritizes.},

How do scholars attempt to unpack it and make connections in a responsible manner?  ~ While the topics of historiography and historical methodology have become increasingly popular, Bloch remains an authority. He argues that history is a whole; no period and no topic can be understood except in relation to other periods and topics. And what is unique about Bloch is that he puts his theories into practice; for example, calling upon both his experience serving in WWI as well as his many years spent in peaceful study and reflection. He also argues that written records are not enough; a historian must draw upon maps, place-names, ancient tools, aerial surveys, folklore, and everything that is available.  ~ This is a work that argues constantly for a wider, more human history. For a history that describes how and why people live and work together. There is a living, breathing connection between the past and the present and it is the historian’s responsibility to do it justice.},

One is the rise of digital media: websites, videogames, social media, and mobile applications, as well as all the remediations of film, television, radio, and print that now appear in digital form. The other development is the end of our collective belief in what we might call Culture with a capital C. Since the middle of the twentieth century, traditional hierarchies of the visual arts, literature, and music as forms of creativity have broken down. This has been accompanied by a decline in the status of the humanities--literary studies in particular, but also history and philosophy. Jay Bolter's THE PLENITUDE is the story of how the dissolution of previously sacrosanct media institutions succumbed to the pervasive power of new forms of media. It is not an argument favoring an elite form of culture over popular culture, but rather a examination of how these changes have affected the divided societies we live in today"--},

With Samarra and Baghdad absorbed by inner conflict in the 860s and trying to recover from it during the following decades, most of the empire fell apart. Having acted as chief commander for al-Muqtazz's side during the civil war of 865, he enjoyed the respect of the soldiers. Brett sees ninth-century Ismailism as part of a larger brew of oppositional trends, the 'sectarian milieu' which John Wansbrough described as the religious and doctrinal environment of early Islam. Al-Mutadid achieved a reputation and popularity that went beyond the army, and his reign constituted the high point of what is known as the 'Abbasid restoration'. The decline of Abbasid power was felt throughout the Islamic world. A powerless Abbasid caliphate was still indispensable to the Buyids for several reasons, including their need for formal legitimacy.},

The illustration we provide comes from early Islamic North Africa. We postulate that during the Medieval period two widely different sociopolitical contexts existed, giving rise to diverse urban patterns. Most importantly, we argue that the second of these patterns represents a widespread situation that is inadequately treated in the literature.},

  abstract = {In the 'encyclopaedic' fourteenth century, Arabic chronicles produced in Mamluk cities bore textual witness to both recent and bygone history, including that of the Fatimids (969–1171CE). For in two centuries of rule over Egypt and North Africa, the Isma'ili Fatimids had left few self-generated historiographical records. Instead, it fell to Ayyubid and Mamluk historians to represent the dynasty to posterity. This monograph sets out to explain how later historians preserved, interpreted and re-organised earlier textual sources.Mamluk historians engaged in a sophisticated archival practice within historiography, rather than uncritically reproducing earlier reports. In a new diplomatic edition, translation and analysis of Mamluk historian Ibn al-Furat's account of late Fatimid rule in The History of Dynasties and Kings, a widely known but barely copied universal chronicle of Islamic history, Fozia Bora traces the survival of historiographical narratives from Fatimid Egypt. Through Ibn al-Furat's text, Bora demonstrates archivality as the heuristic key to Mamluk historical writing.This book is essential for all scholars working on the written culture and history of the medieval Islamic world, and paves the way for a more nuanced reading of pre-modern Arabic chronicles and of the epistemic environment in which they were produced.},

It also contends that scholars have tended to ignore the fact that this periodization was first and foremost an Abbasid claim to power. It investigates the Abbasid-era construction of the past and demonstrates that alternative periodizations were used prior to these massive efforts to enclose the past into a rigid structure, and so it sheds light on forgotten alternative pasts. The links between periodization and space are emphasized, focusing on the example of early Islamic Syria. Indeed, this province largely vanished from the map with the coming of the Abbasids to power since Syria’s memory came to be limited to its Umayyad past. Elaborating upon alternative periodizations, the paper offers a fresh attempt at a history of the meanings (Sinngeschichte) of a long Syrian eighth century, articulated around memory and power.},

Focusing on the interplay of myth, memory, and place, it begins with the Kymin, a hillside site outside the Welsh border town of Monmouth. In about 1800 this site was carefully remodelled to invest it with a series of meanings--urban/rural, enlightened/romantic, Welsh/English/British--through which those who visited it were able to explore and express their ambivalent identities. The eighteenth-century spa of Bath was also "symbolic territory", and in one of its iconic structures, the Circus, myth, memory, and place combined to allow the elite to examine similar issues of identity to those at the Kymin. Central to the mythical element in both sites was the notion of the hero. It was an idea that was to resurface on a grand scale in late Victorian and Edwardian Bath, as the city's historic fabric was reconfigured as a "mausoleum" to Britain's Georgian imperial heroes. The paper concludes by arguing that the identities examined in the paper were closely tied to ones of social class, and that the way forward for social history is a fusion of the cultural and the structural that emphasizes the interaction between the two.},

Using a large new city-specific data set covering Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, we unravel the role of geography and institutions in determining long-run city development in the two regions. We find that the main reasons for the Islamic world's stagnation and Europe's long-term success are specific to each region: any significant positive interaction between cities in the two regions hampered by their different main religious orientation. Together, the long-term consequences of a different choice of main transport mode (camel versus ship) and the development of forms of local participative government in Europe that made cities less dependent on the state explain why Europe's urban development eventually outpaced that in the Islamic world.},

We study and compare existent works in several fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), and Knowledge Extraction (KE). Thus, we illicit their main drawbacks and identify some perspectives, which may be considered by the research community. We also study the characteristics of these types of documents, by enumerating the advantages/limits of using hadith as a language resource. Moreover, our study shows that previous studies used different collections of hadiths, thus making it hard to compare their results objectively. Besides, many preprocessing steps are recurrent through these applications, thus wasting a lot of time. Consequently, the key issues for building generic language resources from hadiths are discussed, taking into account the relevance of related literature and the wide community of researchers that are interested in these narrations. The ultimate goal is to structure hadith books for multiple usages, thus building common collections which may be exploited in future applications.},

The approach is heavily motivated by real-world time series, and by developing a complete approach to model building, estimation, forecasting and control." -~~~~~~~ Mathematical Reviews Bridging classical models and modern topics, the Fifth Edition of Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control maintains a balanced presentation of the tools for modeling and analyzing time series. Also describing ~the latest developments that have occurred in the field over the past decade through applications from areas such as business, finance, and engineering, the Fifth Edition continues to serve as one of the most influential and prominent works on the subject. Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, Fifth Edition provides a clearly written exploration of the key methods for building, classifying, testing, and analyzing stochastic models for time series and describes their use in five important areas of application: forecasting; determining the transfer function of a system; modeling the effects of intervention events; developing multivariate dynamic models; and designing simple control schemes.~ Along with these classical uses, the new edition covers modern topics with new features that include:  A redesigned chapter on multivariate time series analysis with an expanded treatment of Vector Autoregressive, or VAR models, along with a discussion of the analytical tools needed for modeling vector time series An expanded chapter on special topics covering~ unit root testing,~ time-varying volatility~ models such as ARCH and GARCH, nonlinear time series models, and long memory models Numerous examples drawn from finance, economics, engineering, and other related fields The use of the publicly available R software for graphical illustrations and numerical calculations along with scripts that demonstrate the use of R for model building and forecasting Updates to literature references throughout and new end-of-chapter exercises Streamlined chapter introductions and revisions that update and enhance the exposition  Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, Fifth Edition is a valuable real-world reference for researchers and practitioners in time series analysis, econometrics, finance, and related fields. The book is also an excellent textbook for beginning graduate-level courses in advanced statistics, mathematics, economics, finance, engineering, and physics.},

Al-Ṣafadī's biography of the lady provides a rare glance into the life of women of the Mongol royal household during the transitional period which followed the Ilkhanid conversion to Islam. It sheds light on issues such as the relations between the Mamluks and the Ilkhans in light of the latter's conversion to Islam and the influence of the process of Islamization on traditional Mongolian gender related practices. This paper also discusses the motivation of the Mamluk author in including El Qutlugh's unusual story in his biographical dictionaries showing how his choices might have been influenced not only by his own interests but also by what appealed to his readers.},

  abstract = {Humanities Computing (HC) has been in existence since the beginning of computing, and was originally created as an attempt to transform aspects of humanities scholarship – a goal that it retains today. It would seem, however, that to date this central aim has not been achieved. In this paper we argue that HC might be more influential if it moved its operations closer to traditional scholarly methods. To illustrate the issue, we describe four usage paradigms for computing in humanities research. We argue that the conduit model is the one in the minds of most scholars who use computing to support their research today – a model which supports established practice but fails in important ways to take advantage of much of what computing could offer. In contrast, the HC community is much more interested in two other models (labelled here as the transformation and markup models) both of which, it is argued, do not connect well with the activities traditionally associated with the majority of humanities scholarship. We therefore propose a fourth model, the object manipulation model, which we believe is able to take better advantage of the possibilities computers provide to research than the conduit model and is, like it, more closely based on actual majority scholarly practice. We also mention that other models (such as those arising from the work of Druker and McGann) are also possible, and worthy of serious consideration within the HC community.},

  abstract = {One of the major lessons of memory research has been that human memory is fallible, imprecise, and subject to interference. Thus, although observers can remember thousands of images, it is widely assumed that these memories lack detail. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image. Participants viewed pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 h. Afterward, they were shown pairs of images and indicated which of the two they had seen. The previously viewed item could be paired with either an object from a novel category, an object of the same basic-level category, or the same object in a different state or pose. Performance in each of these conditions was remarkably high (92\%, 88\%, and 87\%, respectively), suggesting that participants successfully maintained detailed representations of thousands of images. These results have implications for cognitive models, in which capacity limitations impose a primary computational constraint (e.g., models of object recognition), and pose a challenge to neural models of memory storage and retrieval, which must be able to account for such a large and detailed storage capacity.},

Ifrīqiya was the old Byzantine province of Africa. The difference between the two histories apparent in the difference between the sources goes back to the departure of the Fāṭimid caliph al-Mu˓izz for Egypt in 361/972, leaving his central Mediterranean empire divided into two provinces under viceroys of different provenance. The Norman occupation of the coast of Ifrīqiya, which centred on the capture of al-Mahdiyya in 543/1148 and ended with the fall of the city to the Almohads in 555/1160, terminated the efforts of the Zīrids to regain a measure of power and authority after their flight from Qayrawān.},

The end of the Arab supremacy was complete when in 219/834 the Arabs were struck from the diwan, the list of those entitled to pay as members of the jund, despite their protest that it was theirs by right. The extirpation of the Tulunids brought the return of Egypt to provincial status with a recrudescence of provincial unrest, immediately manifested in the welcome at Fustat to one ibn al-Khalij, or al-Khaliji. Ibn Tughj had no difficulty in returning to Syria to secure its possession, and reconstitute the empire created by Ibn Tulun when he invaded Syria from Egypt. Like that of the Tulunids, that of the Ikhshidids was a ghulam state, in which the payment of the army was central to the administration. After the retreat from Alexandria in 324/936 the threat of Fatimid invasion receded.},

Trade was to be conducted as far as possible in accordance with the Law, and approval was given to the establishment of Muslim communities in the Bilād al-Sūdān under the authority of a nāẓir or 'watchman', with the consent of the pagan king of the country. The formation of Muslim communities on this legal basis, and their incorporation into the pattern of West African society, were important for the subsequent character of Islam in West Africa. Meanwhile, among the 'stateless' Berber peoples of the Western Sahara, the doctrines of the Malikite school were subject to a different interpretation by Ibn Yāsīn, which came into open conflict with the views of al-Qābisī when the Almoravids sacked the Muslim city of Awdaghast for submitting to the pagan king of Ghana. This conflict of attitudes to paganism remained a feature of West African Islam down to the twentieth century.},

The outcome, in the Ottoman empire, was an impressive solution to the problem of state formation and organisation inherent in the kinds of government. Only to the south, across the Sahara in tropical Africa, were the terms of the problem modified by the relationship of Muslims to pagans in lands where they had established themselves by settlement and conversion rather than by conquest. The Arabs, Turks and Berbers who invaded the settled lands of Islam in the fifth/eleventh century were all tribal peoples of the kind described by Ibn Khaldūn.},

Because life history theory focuses on the timing of, and energetic investment in, particular aspects of physiology, such as growth and reproduction, Richard Bribiescas and his fellow anthropologists are now using it in the study of humans. This has led to an increased understanding of human female physiology - especially growth and reproduction - from an evolutionary and life history perspective. However, little attention has been directed toward these characteristics in males. Men provides a new understanding of human male physiology and applies it to contemporary health issues such as prostate cancer, testosterone replacement therapy, and the development of a male contraceptive." "Men proves that understanding human physiology requires global research in traditionally overlooked areas and that evolutionary and life history theory have much to offer toward this endeavor."--Jacket.},

Modern media are replete with alarm over jihad, underage marriage and the threat of amputation or stoning under Shariah law.  Sometimes rumor, sometimes based in fact and often misunderstood, the tenets of Islamic law and dogma were not set in the religion’s founding moments. They were developed over centuries by the clerical class of Muslim scholars.Misquoting Muhammad takes the reader back in time through Islamic civilization and traces how and why such controversies developed, offering an inside view into how key and controversial aspects of Islam took shape. From the protests of the Arab Spring to Istanbul at the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and from the ochre red walls of Delhi’s great mosques to the trade routes of Islam’s Indian Ocean world, Misquoting Muhammad lays out how Muslim intellectuals have sought to balance reason and revelation, weigh science and religion, and negotiate the eternal truths of scripture amid shifting values.},

It will do this through a case study that aims to trace the adoption of formal network methods by archaeologists. A review of the archaeological literature will be confronted with an analysis of a citation network consisting of 33,556 publications and 42,993 citations. The results indicate that a citation network analysis succeeds in quantitatively expressing the intuitive results drawn from the literature review. It also allows for the archaeological literature to be re-contextualized in a larger multidisciplinary body of literature. However, the use of citation network analysis for archaeology is significantly restricted by the limitations of the available citation databases, which are still less representative for the humanities and the social sciences than for the natural sciences. It is suggested that different disciplines in the humanities require distinct strategies for citation data collection and analysis.},

In the course of the paper, some aspects and problems of chapter 11 of version 2.0.0 of TEI P5 (the definition and use of the elements {$<$}line{$>$} and {$<$}mod{$>$} and related issues) will be discussed.},

  abstract = {"In an age of big data, data journalism and with a wealth of quantitative information around us, it is not enough for students to be taught only 100 year old statistical methods using 'out of the box' software. They need to have 21st-century analytical skills too. This is an excellent and student-friendly text from two of the world leaders in the teaching and development of spatial analysis. It shows clearly why the open source software R is not just an alternative to commercial GIS, it may actually be the better choice for mapping, analysis and for replicable research. Providing practical tips as well as fully working code, this is a practical 'how to' guide ideal for undergraduates as well as those using R for the first time. It will be required reading on my own courses." - Richard Harris, Professor of Quantitative Social Science, University of Bristol  R is a powerful open source computing tool that supports geographical analysis and mapping for the many geography and ‘non-geography’ students and researchers interested in spatial analysis and mapping.   This book provides an introduction to the use of R for spatial statistical analysis, geocomputation and the analysis of geographical information for researchers collecting and using data with location attached, largely through increased GPS functionality.   Brunsdon and Comber take readers from ‘zero to hero’ in spatial analysis and mapping through functions they have developed and compiled into R packages. This enables practical R applications in GIS, spatial analyses, spatial statistics, mapping, and web-scraping. Each chapter includes:      Example data and commands for exploring it     Scripts and coding to exemplify specific functionality     Advice for developing greater understanding - through functions such as locator(), View(), and alternative coding to achieve the same ends      Self-contained exercises for students to work through     Embedded code within the descriptive text.   ~This is a definitive 'how to' that takes students - of any discipline - from coding to actual applications and uses of R.

Even if the sources were available to determine the precise percentages of Muslims in the Central Asian, Chinese, Indian or south-eastern populations at any point in time, the characteristics of the faith professed by those Muslims would be seen to change over time.},

This is the likely origin of the printed amulets that have been identified in various collections since the 1890s. If the ṭarsh described by the poets were indeed printblocks, the verses would serve to date medieval Arabic printing and show its geographical extent.

This textbook is our way to share with the DH community the courses and material we prepared for this programme. It is an ideal companion to the online course Scholarly Digital Editions: Manuscripts, Texts and TEI Encoding, freely available on the \#dariahTeach platform.2 If the official Guidelines remain the main resource about the encoding of digital editions in TEI, both this book and the online course offer a different approach by targeting the particular needs of editors of medieval (and more generally manuscript) sources, and translating them into TEI terms.},

As these estimates show, medieval and early modern book production was a dynamic economic sector, with an average annual growth rate of around one percent. Rising production after the middle of the fifteenth century probably resulted from lower book prices and higher literacy. To explain the dynamics of medieval book production, we provide estimates for urbanization rates and for the numbers of universities and monasteries. Monasteries seem to have been most important in the early period, while universities and laypeople dominated the later medieval demand for books.},

The main emphasis of that paper was not on the new procedure but on the broader consequences of our increasing sophistication in making such comparisons and the increasing (although never absolute) reliability of our inferences about authorship. My present objects, accordingly, are to give a more complete account of the procedure itself; to report the outcome of an extensive set of trials; and to consider the strengths and limitations of the new procedure. The procedure offers a simple but comparatively accurate addition to our current methods of distinguishing the most likely author of texts exceeding about 1,500 words in length. It is of even greater value as a method of reducing the field of likely candidates for texts of as little as 100 words in length. Not unexpectedly, it works least well with texts of a genre uncharacteristic of their author and, in one case, with texts far separated in time across a long literary career. Its possible use for other classificatory tasks has not yet been investigated.},

Second, studying the Bedouins can open new perspectives on important debates in Middle Eastern historiography. The paper further contends that the arid lands of the Arab East still need to be explored as a historical region with its own distinct patterns of regional connectivity and political organisation. Finally, we highlight environmental history and the study of emic categories as promising avenues for future research on this region.},

Suggestions are offered as to the value of being able to see synoptically texts which are nominally the same but may vary a little or a lot in their verbal details.

These jurists’ tax policy is explained with reference to Haldon’s concept of the tributary mode of production. It is concluded that according to the jurists, muqāsama favoured a redistribution of surpluses between the state and the landowners which could strengthen relations between the Abbasid state and the powerful landlords in Iraq.},

For both authors, t-tests andlogistic regressions show that the length ofthe words in new works is significantly longerthan that of the old. The principal componentanalyses graphically illustrate the separationbetween old and new texts. The works arecorrectly categorized as old or new with 75 to100\% accuracy and 92\% average accuracy usingdiscriminant analysis-based cross validation. The results imply higher time gap may havepositive impact in separation andcategorization. For Altan a regressionanalysis demonstrates a decrease in averageword length as the age of his column increases. One interesting observation is that for oneword each author has similar preference changesover time.},

  abstract = {This book re-examines the notion of word associations, more precisely collocations. It attempts to come to a potentially more generally applicable definition of collocation and how to best extract, identify and measure collocations. The book highlights the role played by (i) automatic linguistic annotation (part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, etc.), (ii) using semantic criteria to facilitate the identification of collocations, (iii) multi-word structured, instead of the widespread assumption of bipartite collocational structures, for capturing the intricacies of the phenomenon of syntagmatic attraction, (iv) considering collocation and valency as near neighbours in the lexis-grammar continuum and (v) the mathematical properties of statistical association measures in the automatic extraction of collocations from corpora. This book is an ideal guide to the use of statistics in collocation analysis and lexicography, as well as a practical text to the development of skills in the application of computational lexicography. Lexical Collocation Analysis: Advances and Applications begins with a proposal for integrating both collocational and valency phenomena within the overarching theoretical framework of construction grammar. Next the book makes the case for integrating advances in syntactic parsing and in collocational analysis. Chapter 3 offers an innovative look at complementing corpus data and dictionaries in the identification of specific types of collocations consisting of restricted predicate-argument combinations. This strategy complements corpus collocational data with network analysis techniques applied to dictionary entries. Chapter 4 explains the potential of collocational graphs and networks both as a visualization tool and as an analytical technique. Chapter 5 introduces MERGE (Multi-word Expressions from the Recursive Grouping of Elements), a data-driven approach to the identification and extraction of multi-word expressions from corpora. Finally the book concludes with an analysis and evaluation of factors influencing the performance of collocation extraction methods in parsed corpora.},

The history of pearling in the region is reviewed, from the earliest possible references to the mid 20th century. Economic data from the 18th-20th centuries CE is analysed in detail, to define the economic course of the pearling industry during that time, and assess the impact on human settlement in the region. The archaeological data for pearl fishing are then examined, from the 6th millennium BCE onwards, and compared to the historical evidence. The results of archaeological survey in the Abu Dhabi islands region are then taken as a case study, and changes in settlement patterns are related to the historical trajectory of the pearling industry. It is observed that the regional economy became overwhelmingly dependent on the pearl trade in recent centuries, and was increasingly subject to the demands of the global market. /// Cette étude présente une analyse et une synthèse des données historiques et archéologiques sur la pêche des perles dans le Golfe arabo-persique. L'histoire de la pêche des perles dans la région est passée en revue, depuis les plus anciennes références connues qui remontent au milieu du 20e siècle. Les données économiques du 18e au 20e siècle sont analysées en détail pour définir l'évolution de l'industrie perlière pendant cette période et évaluer son incidence sur le peuplement de la région. Les données archéologiques sur la pêche des perles, examinées depuis le 6ème millénaire avant J.-C., ont été comparées aux données historiques. Les résultats des reconnaissances archéologiques dans les îles de la région d'Abu Dhabi sont alors présentées comme étude de cas et les modifications de configuration de l'habitat sont reliées à l'évolution historique de l'industrie perlière. On remarque que l'économie de cette région est devenue presque entièrement dépendante du commerce des perles dans les siècles récents, et qu'elle était de plus en plus assujettie à la demande du marché mondial.},

  abstract = {In recent years, important research on crowdsourcing in the cultural heritage sector has been published, dealing with topics such as the quantity of contributions made by volunteers, the motivations of those who participate in such projects, the design and establishment of crowdsourcing initiatives, and their public engagement value. This article addresses a gap in the literature, and seeks to answer two key questions in relation to crowdsourced transcription: (1) whether volunteers’ contributions are of a high enough standard for creating a publicly accessible database, and for use in scholarly research; and (2) if crowdsourced transcription makes economic sense, and if the investment in launching and running such a project can ever pay off. In doing so, this article takes the award-winning crowdsourced transcription initiative, Transcribe Bentham, which began in 2010, as its case study. It examines a large data set, namely, 4,364 checked and approved transcripts submitted by volunteers between 1 October 2012 and 27 June 2014. These data include metrics such as the time taken to check and approve each transcript, and the number of alterations made to the transcript by Transcribe Bentham staff. These data are then used to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the initiative, and its potential impact upon the ongoing production of The Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham at UCL. Finally, the article proposes more general points about successfully planning humanities crowdsourcing projects, and provides a framework in which both the quality of their outputs and the efficiencies of their cost structures can be evaluated.},

I find that the available data provide support for this interpretation and weigh against some of the most plausible alternatives. For example, I show that while Nile shocks increased historical references to social unrest, deviant floods did not increase a proxy for popular religiosity. Together, the results suggest an increase in the political power of religious leaders during periods of economic downturn.},

  abstract = {Since the eighties, social history in France, as in many other countries, slipped from a macro-social to a micro-social viewpoint. Today, questions about the evolution of social history are becoming more radical still: the reduction of the objects has often led to the disappearance of their social dimension. The definition of social history as such has lost its coherence, whether because French social history has opted for prospects borrowed from other national historiographies (for example social history of politics, social history of the State, gender history), or because social history has been contested by other types of history which denied the primary role of social factors: history of representations, cultural history, anthropological history. It is too easy to interpret these evolutions as a "crisis" or a critical turning point. In fact a critical evaluation of recent works shows more a great fecondity of new approaches and new themes: portraits of groups forgotten by standard works (professions, outsiders, aristocracies, and so on), investigations on social relations until now neglected (gender, generations, private life), cross-fertilization of social history with ethnological, cultural, political, linguistic approaches. Competing paradigms borrowed from different social sciences or dividing sociology lead to an impossibility of synthesis as dreamed by Labrousse or Braudel. Nevertheless, it is possible to imagine new ways of cumulating all this analytical new stuff as different inquiries show on mobilities, polemics on gender history in France, proposals of a cultural history of society (R. Chartier), of a socio-history (G. Noiriel), or of a comparative social history (C. Charle). The main issue is to forget the unquestioned framework of traditional periodization or national scale to invent new prospects adapted to the specificity of the chosen theme organizing this global synthesis. The enduring reflection over the crises of nation and phenomena of memories, dominant in French recent scholarship--which has emulated similar researches in neighboring countries--might be also used as a preliminary travail du deuil, to challenge disciplinary borders and the national unconscious which are the eternal and principal brakes on historical imagination, today and yesterday.},

  abstract = {This book documents the creation of the Bichitra Online Tagore Variorum, a publicly accessible database of Rabindranath Tagore's complete works in Bengali and English totaling some 140,000 pages of primary material. Chapters cover innovative aspects of the site, all replicable in other projects: a hyperbibliography; a search engine and hyperconcordance working across the database; and a unique collation program comparing variant texts at three levels. There are also chapters on the special problems of processing manuscripts, and on planning the website. Early chapters take readers through the history of the project, an overview of Tagore’s works, and the Bengali writing system with the challenges of adapting it to electronic form. The name Bichitra, meaning "various" in Bengali, alludes both to the great variety of Tagore’s works and to their various stages of composition. Beyond their literary excellence, they are notable for their sheer quantity, the number of variant forms of a great many items, and their afterlife in translation, often the poet’s own. Seldom if ever has the same writer revised his material and recast it across genres on such a scale.\mbox\mbox{} Tagore won the Nobel Prize in 1913. By its value-added presentation of this range of material, Bichitra can be a model for future databases covering an author’s complete works or other major corpus of texts. It offers vastly expanded access to Tagore’s writings, and enables new kinds of research including computational text analysis. The “book of the website” shows in technical and human terms how researchers with interests in art, literature and technology can collaborate on cultural informatics projects.},

The SPEI reconstruction successfully reflects the dry and wet periods over the past 451 years, and captures a recent wetting trend that generally agrees with the drought reconstructions for the spruce-dominated area. However, some differences between the tree-ring records from spruce-dominated and juniper-dominated areas reflect regional climate differences. The comparison between drought events in the SPEI reconstruction and historical event of Central Asia reveals drought variations have had profound influences on some historical archives over the past several centuries. This study provides the first long-term SPEI reconstruction and drought evaluation from the low-altitude area of Central Asia, contributing to climate change issues in Central Asia.},

Using the methods of network analysis and document clustering, this article analyzes all the inscriptions extant from Song times for local government schools. It reveals a structural schism in the diffusion of ideas between the Upper Yangzi and other regions of the Song. It also demonstrates the growing intellectual influence of Neo-Confucian ideologues that gradually overtook that of renowned prose-writers.

The crusading pope and the Muslim faqīh guide us to a proper comprehension of the Crusades by refusing to judge the entire movement on the basis of the most recent expression of crusading activity, and they allow us to view the Crusades from Rome and Damascus during the formative period of their development.},

This measure is based on the difficulty Americans have learning other languages. The linguistic distance measure is then used in an analysis of the determinants of English language proficiency among adult immigrants in the USA and Canada. It is shown that, when other determinants of English language proficiency are the same, the greater the measure of linguistic distance, the poorer is the respondent's English language proficiency. This measure can be used in research, evaluation and practitioner analyses, and for diagnostic purposes regarding linguistic minorities in English-speaking countries. The methodology can also be applied to develop linguistic distance measures for other languages.},

We aim at enriching the current theoretical understanding by contextualising digital humanities practices within a semiotic conceptualisation of modelling. A semiotic approach enables us to contextualise modelling in a scholarly framework well suited to humanistic enquiries, forcing us to investigate how models function as signs within specific contexts of production and use. Kralemann and Lattmann’s semiotic model of modelling complemented by Elleström's theories on iconicity are some of the tools we use to inform this semiotic perspective on modelling. We contextualise Kralemann and Lattmann’s theory within modelling practices in digital humanities by using three examples of models representing components and structure of historical artefacts. We show how their model of models can be used to understand and contextualise the models we study and how their classification of model types clarify important aspects of digital humanities modelling practice.},

  abstract = {[The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.]},

Despite the tensions surrounding succession within the Marwanid family, the territorial expansion of the caliphate proceeded apace without any noticeable slowing until the eve of the third fitna. In keeping with the imperial vision established by the time of Abd al-Malik, Marwanid imperial designs were in theory limitless. For all that the Marwanid caliphs saw themselves as God's caliphs, from France to Farghana it was the Syrian tribal armies who were the real world conquerors. The Hijaz and Yemen were excluded from the superprovinces, no doubt because they lacked any active military fronts or waves of settlement. Nowhere can the aspirations of the Marwanid elites be better glimpsed than in the qusur built by caliphs and ashraf throughout the caliphate.},

Cobb overturns previous claims and presents new arguments, such as the idea that the Frankish invasions of the Near East were something of a side-show to the broader internal conflict between Sunnis and Shi'ites in the region. The Race for Paradise moves along two fronts as Cobb stresses that, for medieval Muslims, the contemporaneous Latin Christian expansion throughout the Mediterranean was seen as closely linked to events in the Levant. As a consequence of this expanded geographical range, the book takes a broader chronological range to encompass the campaigns of Spanish kings north of the Ebro and the Norman conquest of Sicily (beginning in 1060), well before Pope Urban II's famous call to the First Crusade in 1095. Finally, The Race for Paradise brilliantly combats the trend to portray the history of the Crusades, particularly the Islamic experience, in simplistic or binary terms. Muslims did not solely experience the Crusades as fanatical warriors or as helpless victims, Cobb writes; as with any other human experience of similar magnitude, the Crusades were experienced in a great variety of ways, ranging from heroic martyrdom, to collaboration, to utter indifference"--},

In some conditions, additional information was provided to help participants with encoding. In every situation, however, auditory memory proved to be systematically inferior to visual memory.

  abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that musicians outperform nonmusicians on a variety of tasks. Here we provide the first evidence that musicians have superior auditory recognition memory for both musical and nonmusical stimuli, compared to nonmusicians. However, this advantage did not generalize to the visual domain. Previously, we showed that auditory recognition memory is inferior to visual recognition memory. Would this be true even for trained musicians? We compared auditory and visual memory in musicians and nonmusicians using familiar music, spoken English, and visual objects. For both groups, memory for the auditory stimuli was inferior to memory for the visual objects. Thus, although considerable musical training is associated with better musical and nonmusical auditory memory, it does not increase the ability to remember sounds to the levels found with visual stimuli. This suggests a fundamental capacity difference between auditory and visual recognition memory, with a persistent advantage for the visual domain.},

  abstract = {Abstract Economic historians, beginning with Avner Greif, have looked to business letters from the Cairo Geniza to understand how medieval merchants in the Islamic Mediterranean organized business collaboration. They have noticed the prevalence of agency relations, which followed “informal” arrangements, unlike formal partnerships, which employed written contracts. This “method” was called ṣuḥba (“companionship”) in Arabic, and it entailed reciprocal exchange of favors between business “friends.” Much attention has been given to what Greif calls “private order” enforcement of agency contracts, whereby merchants belonging to a “closed” consortium reported instances of cheating or opportunism by a fellow merchant, in place of enforcement by religious courts. However, economic historians relying on the Geniza documents have paid inadequate attention to evolving Jewish law in the Islamic milieu. The present article, focusing on a mercantile dispute, brings evidence to show that Jewish legal scholars adopted a feature of Islamic judicial practice to strengthen their role in enforcement of informal agency contracts. In his Code, the Mishneh Torah, Maimonides put the final touches on this accommodation by incorporating agency into the law pertaining to contract enforcement among partners.},

  publisher = {{Princeton University Press}},
  abstract = {What was it like to be poor in the Middle Ages? In the past, the answer to this question came only from institutions and individuals who gave relief to the less fortunate. This book, by one of the top scholars in the field, is the first comprehensive book to study poverty in a premodern Jewish community--from the viewpoint of both the poor and those who provided for them. Mark Cohen mines the richest body of documents available on the matter: the papers of the Cairo Geniza. These documents, located in the Geniza, a hidden chamber for discarded papers situated in a medieval synagogue in Old Cairo, were preserved largely unharmed for more than nine centuries due to an ancient custom in Judaism that prohibited the destruction of pages of sacred writing. Based on these papers, the book provides abundant testimony about how one large and important medieval Jewish community dealt with the constant presence of poverty in its midst. Building on S. D. Goitein's Mediterranean Society and inspired also by research on poverty and charity in medieval and early modern Europe, it provides a clear window onto the daily lives of the poor. It also illuminates private charity, a subject that has long been elusive to the medieval historian. In addition, Cohen's work functions as a detailed case study of an important phenomenon in human history. Cohen concludes that the relatively narrow gap between the poor and rich, and the precariousness of wealth in general, combined to make charity "one of the major agglutinates of Jewish associational life" during the medieval period.},

  abstract = {Throughout most of the nineteenth century, steamships were the main tool of British informal imperialism in what is now southern Iraq. Despite that centrality, steam shipping on the Tigris was primarily characterized by environmental and political precariousness. This article explores the steamship business of the Lynch Company, which operated on the Tigris beginning in 1861. It examines the political controversies surrounding irrigation and the expansion of the steam fleet as windows on the complex relationship between ecological vulnerability and the practice of empire and diplomacy, arguing that the states of environmental and geopolitical precariousness in which steamships operated reinforced one another, eventually coming to define the British steam enterprise on the Tigris. This precariousness helped make steamships major geopolitical actors, shaping British-Ottoman relations as well as local trade and development policies. The persistence of environmental challenges meant that the Lynch steamships, along with their Ottoman counterparts, simultaneously shaped and were incorporated into local trade and shipping networks, as well as the tribal prestige politics of raiding. On local and international levels, environmental and political issues were intertwined, and steam shipping was crucial to both. The precarious technology that formed the crux of informal imperial intervention on the Tigris is indicative of a kind of empire in which the environment significantly shaped the possibilities of imperial intervention. Precariousness—both environmental and political—came to define technology and empire in late Ottoman Iraq.},

Many Muslim towns in al-Andalus and the Maghrib were famous for textiles woven in local ateliers. During the early middle ages, slaves represented one of the most important exports from Europe to the Muslim world, but sources of northern slaves became limited with the expansion and Christianisation of European territories. More than in the eastern Islamic world, much of the commercial traffic in the Mediterranean involved a combination of maritime and overland travel.},

  abstract = {Moroccan autonomy was threatened from the east by Ottoman expansion into North Africa during the early tenth/sixteenth century. The Ottomans presented a unique challenge in that, as co-religionists, they appealed to Moroccan leaders in the name of Islamic unity and as defenders of the abode of Islam from the Christian Europeans. Moroccan political history during the tenth/sixteenth to twelfth/eighteenth centuries reflects an era in which two dominant sultans, Mawlāy Aḥmad al-Manṣūr and Mawlāy Ismā˓īl were able to create prosperous and relatively successful states, while several other sultans succeeded in maintaining sufficient central authority to sustain functional governments. TheSa˓dī dynasty first arose in the early tenth/sixteenth century, largely in response to Portuguese incursions from their fortresses along the Atlantic coast. Trade agreements signed between Morocco and the European powers were heavily weighted in favour of European interests. The establishment of the Sharīfīan dynasties produced the most durable form of government in the Islamic world.},

  abstract = {State and religion, two of the oldest institutions known to mankind, have historically had a close relationship with each other, but the disestablishment of state religions has been one of the most drastic institutional transformations that has taken place in the modern era. We offer a systematic analysis of the development of secular states based on a political economy approach that is centered on the notion of legitimacy. Viewing religion as a legitimizing force for political leaders, we consider the factors affecting the cost and benefits of alternative sources of legitimacy, such as the differential abilities of religious and secular sources to legitimize political rulers and historical inertia that shaped the cost of monitoring legitimizing agents. To examine this argument empirically, we built a cross-national time-series dataset for the relationship between state and religion since the year 1000. We first use the data to examine the evolution of secularism over time and its variation across religious traditions. We then use regression analysis and an instrumental variables approach to identify the influences on the adoption of secular state, such as concentration in the religion market, religious differences between rulers and the general population, historical inertia of a state, and the prevailing political regime. We address endogeneity concerns regarding the relationship between religious concentration and state secularism by exploiting variation among territories in their geographic distance to religious “capitals” of the world as an instrument.},

Because the Google Ngram data set is not an unbiased sample, and does not include metadata, there are several pitfalls when using it to study language or the popularity of terms. Medical literature accounts for a large, but shifting, share of the corpus, which does not take into account how often the literature is printed, or read.},

It further argues that the Shahnama's aim, content, and execution differed from the histories and poetry produced in the decades immediately preceding and succeeding it, which would account for the lag in its acceptance and popularity. This led later biographers to superimpose their regret over Firdausi' s treatment onto Sultan Mahmud Ghazni, who by their accounts denied him the fame and glory he deserved in his lifetime.]},

Nevertheless, they resemble the sixteenth‐ and seventeenth‐century Cabinets de curiosités in their limited ability to support scholarship or address information needs of defined communities of users.

Humayun's young son Akbar succeeded to the Mughal throne in 963/1556 in his twelfth year. The reign of Akbar's successor Salim or Jahangir, the 'World-seizer', vividly illustrates the importance of idiosyncratic personality and also witnessed the beginnings of Sikhism as a social and political force. Shah Jahan turned his back on Akbar's and Jahangir's sympathetic attitude towards non-Muslims, and he also exhibited little of the relentless intellectual curiosity of Akbar or the deeply emotional artistic sensitivity of Jahangir. One of the earliest signs of Shah Jahan's lofty ambition was the construction of the Peacock Throne, a gem-encrusted monument that was commissioned in 1037/1628 and completed seven years later.},

Using the example of protest discourse in Twitter, in the field of anti-Islamic ‘Pegida’ demonstrations, a three-step method of collecting, reducing and interpreting salient data is proposed. Each step is aligned with opera-tive medial features of the microblog: hashtags, retweets and @-interactions. The exemplary analysis reveals the importance of discussions of attendance numbers in protest discourse and the asymmetry between administrative (i.e. the police) and non-administrative discourse agents. Furthermore, it exemplifies how frequency analysis and sequence analysis can be combined for research in media linguistics.},

The Arab conquests in what would become the Islamic east entailed a number of demographic, social, economic, political and cultural changes that would help determine the parameters for the development of this area. The administration of the fiscal apparatus depended heavily on the same class that had played that role in Sasanian times. Political economy, rather than fiscal administration, provides a better guide to distinguishing the various regions of the Islamic east and following their development. Following al-Mamun's accession to the caliphate and return to Baghdad, the history of the Islamic east becomes primarily that of largely autonomous, hereditary, regional dynasties, namely the Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids and Ghaznavids. The Saffarids represented in almost every conceivable way the antithesis of the Tahirid version of regionalism.},

In contrast, legal realists argue that the rational application of legal reasons does not sufficiently explain the decisions of judges and that psychological, political, and social factors influence judicial rulings. We test the common caricature of realism that justice is “what the judge ate for breakfast” in sequential parole decisions made by experienced judges. We record the judges’ two daily food breaks, which result in segmenting the deliberations of the day into three distinct “decision sessions.” We find that the percentage of favorable rulings drops gradually from ≈65\% to nearly zero within each decision session and returns abruptly to ≈65\% after a break. Our findings suggest that judicial rulings can be swayed by extraneous variables that should have no bearing on legal decisions.},

Contrary to common spelling errors, real-word errors cannot be detected by conventional spelling correction methods. The real-word correction model proposed by Mays, Damerau, and Mercer showed a great performance in different evaluations. In this research, however, a new hybrid approach is proposed which relies on statistical and syntactic knowledge to detect and correct real-word errors. In this model, Constraint Grammar is used to discriminate among sets of correction candidates in the search space. Mays, Damerau, and Mercer’s trigram approach is manipulated to estimate the probability of syntactically well-formed correction candidates. The approach proposed here is tested on the Wall Street Journal corpus. The model can prove to be more practical than some other models, such as WordNet-based method of Hirst and Budanitsky and fixed windows size method of Wilcox-O’Hearn and Hirst.},

  abstract = {"Based on a variety of largely unutilized printed, as well as documentary and manuscript sources collected from archives in the Middle East, North Africa, India and Europe, this dissertation is a longue duree study of the evolution of the conception and function of hadith transmission following the establishment of the hadith canon in the tenth century. It documents how the emergence of the hadith canon plunged Muslim religious scholars in a deep controversy. The establishment of a stable written hadith canon negated the need for the continued oral transmission of hadith. The institution of hadith transmission in the oral/aural mode was, however, integral to the community of hadith scholars' culture and self-image. Hadith scholars saw themselves as the heirs and carriers of a continuous tradition stretching back to the Prophet and the transmission of hadith and the associated chain of transmission was symbolic of this status. On the other hand, scholars, jurists in particular, wanted to be able to harness the authority of the hadith canon as evidence directly without citing a personal chain of transmission. The debates over the value and need of continued oral transmission that erupted in this context are traced revealing how hadith scholars developed an ideology to sustain and give meaning to the chain of transmission in spite of its obsolescence. This ideology asserted that, among other things, the chain of transmission was an essential and unique trait of the Muslim community linking successive generations of Muslims to the Prophet and distinguishing them from the Jews and Christians that preceded them and therefore must be preserved for its own sake, regardless of the fact that the establishment of a stable written hadith corpus had made the original function of the chain of transmission obsolete. It is demonstrated that hadith scholars successfully mobilized this ideology to sustain hadith transmission as an act of piety and further to preserve the chain of transmission as a species of social capital, which scholars could use to establish their position and relative merit within scholarly networks and further which they used in the reproduction of their group identity. This profound shift in the conception of the chain of transmission resulted in a radical reworking of the theory and protocols that had originally been developed to govern the transmission of hadith, as well as the culture and norms of transmission. This new conception of hadith transmission resulted in the emergence of a number of popular and enduring genres of hadith literature, which scholars used as vehicles to express their connection to the Prophet and previous generations of masters through the presentations of chains of transmission. The development of these genres is traced and for the first time their functions are situated in this context of an evolving conception of hadith transmission. The dissertation concludes with an examination of the fate of hadith transmission in the twentieth century following the rise of the various Islamic reform movements and the radical changes to the social and educational institutions of the majority of dar al-Islam."--Pages v-vi.},

The first West Syrian historical texts were produced in the sixth century, when the history of what would become the Syrian Orthodox Church began. An examination of contemporary sources and myths of origins shows that the ethnic origins of the Abgarid dynasty played no part in Syrian \&apos;ethnogenesis\&apos;, but that there existed a notion of Syro-Mesopotamian origins, closely related to a supposed homeland, that of Aram. An acknowledged common ancestry going back to the Chaldean and Assyrian Empires relies on a common language more than a common homeland or sovereign. Whereas the Assyrians came to personify the ever-hostile Persian neighbour, a sort of stereotypical enemy, the Hellenistic kings were perceived as having effected a synthesis of the double Syro-Mesopotamian and Greek culture. The Seleucid era, as adopted by the Edessans, thus remained in use regardless of the prevailing political powers and is an assertion of independence and a strong local identity marker, being a rejection of the local Antiochene as well as the imperial Byzantine eras. The Syrian Orthodox also developed an innovative method of writing the history of their separated Church, producing a new genre consisting of lengthy chronicles written in several parts or columns, in which political and ecclesiastical history were kept separate. This Syrian Orthodox method of writing history is the only truly distinctive Syrian Orthodox literary genre.},

  abstract = {Reading, Writing, and Face Recognition Reading, not to mention writing and texting, is a relatively recent invention, and hence it is believed that a preliterate brain must adapt on the fly, so to speak, in learning how to process written words, rather than being able to rely upon evolutionarily ancient modifications of the visual system pathways. Dehaene et al. (p. 1359, published online 11 November) examined the neural response to a range of visual stimuli in three groups: illiterate adults, adults who learned to read as children, and adults who learned to read as adults. Reading induced a greater facility in processing horizontally oriented stimuli at early stages in the visual pathway and was also associated with the appearance of an area specialized for words. This gain of function appeared to occur at a cost—the area in the temporal cortex devoted to face processing shrank. Does literacy improve brain function? Does it also entail losses? Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain responses to spoken and written language, visual faces, houses, tools, and checkers in adults of variable literacy (10 were illiterate, 22 became literate as adults, and 31 were literate in childhood). As literacy enhanced the left fusiform activation evoked by writing, it induced a small competition with faces at this location, but also broadly enhanced visual responses in fusiform and occipital cortex, extending to area V1. Literacy also enhanced phonological activation to speech in the planum temporale and afforded a top-down activation of orthography from spoken inputs. Most changes occurred even when literacy was acquired in adulthood, emphasizing that both childhood and adult education can profoundly refine cortical organization. Reading changes the mind.

By reviewing studies of illiterate subjects, we propose specific hypotheses on how the functions of core brain systems are partially reoriented or 'recycled' when learning to read. Literacy acquisition improves early visual processing and reorganizes the ventral occipito-temporal pathway: responses to written characters are increased in the left occipito-temporal sulcus, whereas responses to faces shift towards the right hemisphere. Literacy also modifies phonological coding and strengthens the functional and anatomical link between phonemic and graphemic representations. Literacy acquisition therefore provides a remarkable example of how the brain reorganizes to accommodate a novel cultural skill.},

Kuhn described scientists as autonomous agents and an emergent pattern of evolving paradigms. The missing link in his account is then a mechanism by which this pattern self-organizes from the interactions of autonomous scientists without centralized control. This paper exploits advances in agent-based modeling and stigmergy to fill the missing link in Kuhn's account. A complete agent-based model of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions could lead to a better understanding of the contribution of the evolution of the social structure of science to its success.},

  abstract = {Extensive survey of paleocourses of the Ili delta discovered archaeological findings that, chronologically attributed and systematized, allowed the historical reconstruction of the human occupation of the delta. Until recently the colonization was believed to have begun only during medieval times. We argue it began much earlier at the start of the Bronze Age of Kazakhstan (second half of the III millennium BC) under the impulse of new economical activities based on stockbreeding and bronze metallurgy. The basic method of research consisted in surveys, collection of surface finds and documentation of hydrogeological and climatic data. The correlation between the two types of information gives an idea of the factors that influenced the distribution of habitats, mostly represented by winter camps. Their number and concentration change by epoch, pointing to changes in both cultural proclivities and environmental factors. The understanding of the whole historical process requires background knowledge of the hydrological history of the Ili delta, a complex system involving active distributaries and intermittent or inactive paleo-courses, and showing the anticlockwise rotation of 5 successive deltas. Generally speaking, arid climate phases stabilize the delta, pluvial phases favor changes in various directions. Human colonization concerned the two Holocene deltas preceding the modern one: relict terraces of the Uzunaral delta (8–4 ka BP) and terraces of mild active distributaries of the Bakanas delta (4000–250 BP), subject during the last 4000 years to complex geomorphological and hydrological changes that, when reconstructed and correlated with the distribution of finds, explain the location of habitats and allow the mutual chronological attribution of geological and cultural deposits.},

  abstract = {This textbook examines empirical linguistics from a theoretical linguist’s perspective. It provides both a theoretical discussion of what quantitative corpus linguistics entails and detailed, hands-on, step-by-step instructions to implement the techniques in the field. The statistical methodology and R-based coding from this book teach readers the basic and then more advanced skills to work with large data sets in their linguistics research and studies. Massive data sets are now more than ever the basis for work that ranges from usage-based linguistics to the far reaches of applied linguistics. This book presents much of the methodology in a corpus-based approach. However, the corpus-based methods in this book are also essential components of recent developments in sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, computational linguistics, and psycholinguistics. Material from the book will also be appealing to researchers in digital humanities and the many non-linguistic fields that use textual data analysis and text-based sensorimetrics. Chapters cover topics including corpus processing, frequencing data, and clustering methods. Case studies illustrate each chapter with accompanying data sets, R code, and exercises for use by readers. This book may be used in advanced undergraduate courses, graduate courses, and self-study.},

  abstract = {Desktop publishing (DTP) is the creation of documents using page layout software on a personal ("desktop") computer. It was first used almost exclusively for print publications, but now it also assists in the creation of various forms of online content. Desktop publishing software can generate layouts and produce typographic-quality text and images comparable to traditional typography and printing. Desktop publishing is also the main reference for digital typography. This technology allows individuals, businesses, and other organizations to self-publish a wide variety of content, from menus to magazines to books, without the expense of commercial printing.Desktop publishing often requires the use of a personal computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create documents for either large-scale publishing or small-scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution — although a non-WYSIWYG system such as LaTeX could also be used for the creation of highly-structured and technically-demanding documents as well. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than word processing. However, word processing software has evolved to include some, though by no means all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing.The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for point of sale displays, presentations, infographics, brochures, business cards, promotional items, trade show exhibits, retail package designs and outdoor signs. Although what is classified as "DTP software" is usually limited to print and PDF publications, DTP isn't limited to print. The content produced by desktop publishers may also be exported and used for electronic media. The job descriptions that include "DTP," such as DTP artist, often require skills using software for producing e-books, web content, and web pages, which may involve web design or user interface design for any graphical user interface.},

These scholars have, however, given little attention to the role of periodization. By contrast, this study suggests that periodization has been a central element of historiography in the monarchies. Many textbooks and other major works in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Jordan, and Morocco follow two broad tendencies in terms of periodization. The first tendency is to merge dynastic and national periods and to start the history of the country essentially with the rise of the contemporary ruling family. The second tendency is to integrate the contemporary dynasty into the history of a longer, sometimes perennial, monarchy. Nevertheless, official dynastic periodization has not determined all historical writing in the monarchies. Local and tribal historians often developed periodizations centered on specific cities or tribes and also imagined a much longer history than that of the contemporary dynasty.},

Reflecting communal adaptations of the Sufi dhikr, or “remembrance” of God, as part of healing or funerary ceremonies, these rites were reclassified, in Soviet ethnographic literature, as vestiges of “shamanism,” and thus largely escaped notice by western observers of “Soviet Islam,” who imagined ‘Sufism’ in terms of clandestine militant organizations intent on undermining the Soviet regime. This paper explores the reclassification of Sufi activity as shamanism, notes historical evidence on the diffusion of Sufi rites into wider public circles, and suggests some implications of these developments for our understanding of Soviet Islam, Central Asian Sufism, and the phenomena of “shamanism.”},

The book has a wide-ranging chronological and geographic scope, from early Neolithic to late Iron Age and from Western Europe to East Asia. It includes world-renowned sites and artefact collections such as the Tollense Valley Bronze Age battlefield (Germany), the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Tanum (Sweden), and the British Museum collection of bronze weaponry from the late Shang period (China). Original case studies are presented in each section by a diverse international authorship.The study of warfare and violence in prehistoric and pre-literate societies has been at the forefront of archaeological debate since the publication of Keeley’s provocative monograph ‘War Before Civilization’ (Oxford 1996). The problem has been approached from a number of standpoints including anthropological and behavioural studies of interpersonal violence, osteological examinations of sharp lesions and blunt-force traumas, wear analysis of ancient weaponry, and field experiments with replica weapons and armour. This research, however, is often confined within the boundaries of the various disciplines and specialist fields. In particular, a gap can often be detected between the research approaches grounded in the humanities and social sciences and those based on the archaeological sciences. The consequence is that, to this day, the subject is dominated by a number of undemonstrated assumptions regarding the nature of warfare, combat, and violence in non-literate societies. Moreover, important methodological questions remain unanswered: can we securely distinguish between violence-related and accidental trauma on skeletal remains? To what extent can wear analysis shed light on long-forgotten fighting styles? Can we design meaningful combat tests based on historic martial arts? And can the study of rock-art unlock the social realities of prehistoric warfare? By breaking the mould of entrenched subject boundaries, this edited volume promotes interdisciplinary debate in the study of prehistoric warfare and violence by presenting a number of innovative approaches that integrate qualitative and quantitative methods of research and analysis.},

D. 541. Based primarily on the Arabic plague treatises written after the Black Death (the second plague pandemic in the mid-fourteenth century), the history of the plague epidemics through the Umaiyad Period has been reconstructed. These epidemics provoked medical and religio-legal explanations and prescriptions, which have strongly influenced the attitudes and behavior of the Muslim community toward the disease. Besides the deaths of important men by plague, it is suggested that the endemic nature of plague during the early Islamic Empire may have significantly retarded population growth and debilitated Muslim society in Syria and Iraq during the Umaiyad Period.},

Scholars of early Islamic history have shown increased interest in developing new approaches and methods, and in looking at such things as social history, gender relations, identity formation and economic history. Beyond the thorny problems posed by the heritage of the polemical tradition and by the deficiencies of the sources for early Islamic history, there exist other problems of perception and conceptualisation, as well as practical obstacles, that have affected Western approaches to early Islamic history.},

It discusses different notions of periodization, in particular those advanced by Fernand Braudel and others of the Annales School and the concept of “Zeitschichten” proposed by Reinhart Koselleck. It surveys some of the periodizations that have traditionally been applied specifically in the realm of the history of the Islamic Near East and a number of essays discussing the periodization of Islamic history (especially those of S. D. Goitein and M. Morony). It argues that the notion of an “ideal” or “perfect” periodization of history (or of any subsection of it) that meets all needs is futile. Periodization must be seen, rather, as a tool employed by the historian that highlights a particular set of developments in a society, so that many different periodizations are possible and, indeed, desirable depending on what the historian wishes to understand. The historian must consider what development she wishes to articulate from the past and choose or fashion a periodization that most clearly illuminates that development.},

The essays and discussion topics were posted on a WordPress platform with a special plug-in that allowed readers to add paragraph-level comments in the margins, transforming the work into socially networked texts. This first installment drew an enthusiastic audience, over 50 comments on the texts, and over 1,000 unique visitors to the site from across the globe, with many who stayed on the site for a significant period of time to read the work. To facilitate this new volume, Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki designed a born-digital, open-access platform to capture reader comments on drafts and shape the book as it developed. Following a period of open peer review and discussion, the finished product now presents 20 essays from a wide array of notable scholars, each examining (and then breaking apart and reexamining) how digital and emergent technologies have changed the ways that historians think, teach, author, and publish"--},

After establishing when, where, and, most importantly, why good riding began, Drews goes on to show how riding raiders terrorized the civilized world in the seventh century BC, and how central cavalry was to the success of the Median and Persian empires." "Drawing on archaeological, iconographic, and textual evidence, this is the first book devoted to the question of when horseback riders became important in combat.

Drawing together the work of established and emerging researchers, it gives pause at a crucial moment in the history of technology in order to offer a sustained reflection on the practices involved in producing, editing and reading digital scholarly editions--and the theories that underpin them. The unrelenting progress of computer technology has changed the nature of textual scholarship at the most fundamental level: the way editors and scholars work, the tools they use to do such work and the research questions they attempt to answer have all been affected. Each of the essays in Digital Scholarly Editing approaches these changes with a different methodological consideration in mind. Together, they make a compelling case for re-evaluating the foundation of the discipline--one that tests its assertions against manuscripts and printed works from across literary history, and the globe. The sheer breadth of Digital Scholarly Editing, along with its successful integration of theory and practice, help redefine a rapidly-changing field, as its firm grounding and future-looking ambit ensure the work will be an indispensable starting point for further scholarship.

  abstract = {Purpose A Recent work in information studies re-engages with theories of subject enunciation first developed in the work of twentieth century structuralist and post-structuralist critics. To date this work has not been extended to the analysis of data visualizations. The purpose of this paper is to assert that information visualizations embody specific dynamics of positionality for which linguist Emile Benveniste’s formulation of a speaking and spoken subject provides a critical analytic framework. In particular, enunciative theory can be used to explicitly address the mechanisms of power formation in information graphics “spreadsheets, charts and interfaces” that are frequently seen as mere presentations of quantitative or statistical information. This approach is based on attention to the performative aspects of graphic expression and the ways familiar features such as frontality framing and scale can be read critically. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical argument that applies literature in enunciation as developed in linguistics, film theory, and psychoanalysis to information visualizations. The paper makes specific analyses of the graphical features of spreadsheets, common charts and graphs, and interfaces to show how they create speaking and spoken subject positions. Findings The theory of enunciation is useful in understanding the ways information representations, particularly visualizations of data, work to produce power relations. Research limitations/implications The topic may seem to draw on theoretical positions that are associated with structural and post-structural theory popular three decades ago, but since the study of enunciation was never applied to information visualizations, the work feels timely. Recent work in information studies has re-engaged with these theoretical issues, but not applied them to charts, graphs, and other visual forms.

  abstract = {[19-21, 2010-05] The Quranic Arabic Corpus (http://corpus.quran.com) is an annotated linguistic resource with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar. The motivation behind this work is to produce a resource that enables further analysis of the Quran, the 1,400 year old central religious text of Islam. This paper describes a new approach to morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic, a genre difficult to compare with other forms of Arabic. Processing Quranic Arabic is a unique challenge from a computational point of view, since the vocabulary and spelling differ from Modern Standard Arabic. The Quranic Arabic Corpus differs from other Arabic computational resources in adopting a tagset that closely follows traditional Arabic grammar. We made this decision in order to leverage a large body of existing historical grammatical analysis, and to encourage online collaborative annotation. In this paper, we discuss how the unique challenge of morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic is solved using a multi-stage approach. The different stages include automatic morphological tagging using diacritic edit-distance, two-pass manual verification, and online collaborative annotation. This process is evaluated to validate the appropriateness of the chosen methodology.},

  abstract = {Research into statistical parsing for English has enjoyed over a decade of successful results. However, adapting these models to other languages has met with difficulties. Previous comparative work has shown that Modern Arabic is one of the most difficult languages to parse due to rich morphology and free word order. Classical Arabic is the ancient form of Arabic, and is understudied in computational linguistics, relative to its worldwide reach as the language of the Quran. The thesis is based on seven publications that make significant contributions to knowledge relating to annotating and parsing Classical Arabic. Classical Arabic has been studied in depth by grammarians for over a thousand years using a traditional grammar known as i’rāb (إعغاة ). Using this grammar to develop a representation for parsing is challenging, as it describes syntax using a hybrid of phrase-structure and dependency relations. This work aims to advance the state-of-the-art for hybrid parsing by introducing a formal representation for annotation and a resource for machine learning. The main contributions are the first treebank for Classical Arabic and the first statistical dependency-based parser in any language for ellipsis, dropped pronouns and hybrid representations. A central argument of this thesis is that using a hybrid representation closely aligned to traditional grammar leads to improved parsing for Arabic. To test this hypothesis, two approaches are compared. As a reference, a pure dependency parser is adapted using graph transformations, resulting in an 87.47\% F1-score. This is compared to an integrated parsing model with an F1-score of 89.03\%, demonstrating that joint dependency-constituency parsing is better suited to Classical Arabic. The Quran was chosen for annotation as a large body of work exists providing detailed syntactic analysis. Volunteer crowdsourcing is used for annotation in combination with expert supervision. A practical result of the annotation effort is the corpus website: http://corpus.quran.com, an educational resource with over two million users per year.},

The first task outperforms Burrows’ Delta by a wide margin on short texts and a small margin on long texts. The second task has no such benchmark with existing methods. The data set for evaluating the method consists of speeches from the US House and Senate from 1995 to 2013. This data set contains both a large number of texts (42,000 in the test sets) and a large number of speakers (over 800). The article shows that this approach to authorship analysis is more accurate than existing approaches given a data set with hundreds of authors. Further, this profile-based method makes new types of analysis possible by looking at types of individuals as well as at specific individuals.},

These are phenomena that involve networks, incentives, and the aggregate behavior of groups of people; they are based on the links that connect us and the ways in which our decisions can have subtle consequences for others. This introductory undergraduate textbook takes an interdisciplinary look at economics, sociology, computing and information science, and applied mathematics to understand networks and behavior. It describes the emerging field of study that is growing at the interface of these areas, addressing fundamental questions about how the social, economic, and technological worlds are connected"--Provided by publisher.},

In an effort to retrieve his past, he withdraws to the family home somewhere in the hills between Milan and Turin. There, in the sprawling attic, he searches through boxes of old newspapers, comics, records, photo albums, and adolescent diaries. And so Yambo relives the story of his generation: Mussolini, Catholic education and guilt, Josephine Baker, Flash Gordon, Fred Astaire. His memories run wild, and the life racing before his eyes takes the form of a graphic novel. Yambo struggles through the frames to capture one simple, innocent image: that of his first love.},

Although intuition suggests picking the most typical texts (whatever ‘typical’ means) by the authors studied, any arbitrary choice might substantially affect the final results. Thus, to eschew cherry picking, we introduce a method of verification of the choice of ‘typical’ samples, inspired by k-fold cross-validation procedures. Namely, we use a bootstrap-like approach to choose randomly, in 500 iterations, the samples for the training and the test sets. Next, we examine the obtained 500 attribution accuracy scores: if the density function shows widespread results, the corpus is assumed to be very sensitive to the permutations of the training set. To test this methodology empirically, we have selected roughly similar corpora in five languages: English, French, German, Italian, and Polish. The results show considerable resistance of the English corpus to permutations, while the other corpora turned out to be more dependent on the choice of the samples; the Polish corpus produces both accuracy and consistency below any acceptable standards.},

A few controlled tests for different sample lengths, languages, and genres are discussed and compared. Depending on the corpus used, the minimal sample length varied from 2,500 words (Latin prose) to 5,000 or so words (in most cases, including English, German, Polish, and Hungarian novels). Another observation is connected with the method of sampling: contrary to common sense, randomly excerpted ‘bags of words’ turned out to be much more effective than the classical solution, i.e. using original sequences of words (‘passages’) of desired size. Although the tests have been performed using the Delta method (Burrows, J.F. (2002). ‘Delta’: a measure of stylistic difference and a guide to likely authorship. Literary and Linguistic Computing, 17(3): 267–87) applied to the most frequent words, some additional experiments have been conducted for support vector machines and k-NN applied to most frequent words, character 3-grams, character 4-grams, and parts-of-speech-tag 3-grams. Despite significant differences in overall attributive success rate between particular methods and/or style markers, the minimal amount of textual data needed for reliable authorship attribution turned out to be method-independent.},

Relying on contaminated data is similar to using dirty test tubes in a laboratory: it inescapably means falling into systematic error. An important question is what degree of nonchalance is acceptable to obtain sufficiently reliable results. The present study attempts to verify the impact of unwanted noise in a series of experiments conducted on several corpora of English, German, Polish, Ancient Greek, and Latin prose texts. In 100 iterations, a given corpus was gradually damaged, and controlled tests for authorship were applied. The first experiment was designed to show the correlation between a dirty corpus and attribution accuracy. The second was aimed to test how disorder in word frequencies—produced by scribal and/or editorial modifications—affects the attribution abilities of particular corpora. The goal of the third experiment was to test how much ‘authorial’ data a given text needs to have to trace authorial fingerprint through a mass of external quotations.},

  abstract = {This article introduces a new stylometric method that combines supervised machine-learning classification with the idea of sequential analysis. Unlike standard procedures, aimed at assessing style differentiation between discrete text samples, the new method, supported with compact visualization, tries to look inside a text represented as a set of linearly sliced chunks, in order to test their stylistic consistency. Three flavors of the method have been introduced: (1) Rolling SVM, relying on the support vector machines (SVM) classifier, (2) Rolling NSC, based on the nearest shrunken centroids method, and (3) Rolling Delta, using the classic Burrowsian measure of similarity. The technique is primarily intended to assess mixed authorship; however, it can be also used as a magnifying glass to inspect works with unclear stylometric signal. To demonstrate its applicability, three different examples of collaborative work have been briefly discussed: (1) the 13th-century French allegorical poem Roman de la Rose , (2) a 15th-century translation of the Bible into Polish known as Queen Sophia’s Bible , and (3) The Inheritors , a novel collaboratively written by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford in 1901.},

A promising way of extending cluster analysis dendrograms with a self-validating procedure involves producing numerous particular ‘snapshots’, or dendrograms produced using different input parameters, and combining them all into the form of a consensus tree. Significantly better results, however, can be obtained using a new visualization technique, which combines the idea of nearest neighborhood derived from cluster analysis, the idea of hammering out a clustering consensus from bootstrap consensus trees, with the idea of mapping textual similarities onto a form of a network. Additionally, network analysis seems to be a good solution for large data sets.},

In these networks, nodes are function words and directed edges between two nodes represent the relative frequency of directed co-appearance of the two words. For every analyzed play, a WAN is constructed and these are aggregated to generate author profile networks. We first study the similarity of writing styles between Early English playwrights by comparing the profile WANs. The accuracy of using WANs for authorship attribution is then demonstrated by attributing known plays among six popular playwrights. Moreover, the WAN method is shown to outperform other frequency-based methods on attributing Early English plays. In addition, WANs are shown to be reliable classifiers even when attributing collaborative plays. For several plays of disputed co-authorship, a deeper analysis is performed by attributing every act and scene separately, in which we both corroborate existing breakdowns and provide evidence of new assignments.},

Aʿyan and Zuhayr b. al-Musayyab b. Zuhayr; d) The armies of al-Ḥasan b. Sahl in al-ʿIrāq from 198 or 199/813-814, which at the beginning mainly consisted of the armies of Harthama and Zuhayr b. al-Musayyab, the Abnāwīs; e) The stiff opposition to al-Maʾmūn and to al-Faḍl b. Sahl in Khurāsān. A notable opposition to al-Maʾmūn and al-Faḍl b. Sahl was that of Harthama b. Aʿyan and another senior Abnāwī. It seems that the main reason for this opposition, which eventually ended in Harthama's execution in Marw, was his opposition to the murder of al-Amīn that was carried out with the agreement and approval of al-Maʾmūn. Close study of the evidence on the senior commanders who were sent by al-Maʾmūn from Marw to al-ʿIrāq (between 200-203/815-818) reveals that most of them were in fact Arabs, or belonged to veteran families of the Abnāʾ. Only rare information is given about the ethnic nature of their contingents; there is no evidence of non-Arab commanders or troops sent from Marw.},

It is difficult to discern the character of the Shākiriyya in the service of the Arab commanders in Central Asia from the Arabic sources. They provide no information on ethnic composition, mobilization, military training or potential ties between a commander/master and his Shākir. This applies mainly to the Umawī period, but also to the first ʿAbbāsī period up to al-Maʾ- mūn’s rule (813-833). It is also impossible to determine from them the possible connections between the ancient Central Asian military institutions and military institutions in the Islamic world. From evidence about the Shākiriyya in the Arabic sources we can usually discern a distinct military character, though it is noteworthy that in some cases the term Shākirī can be translated as meaning a loyal adherent, or even a servant.While relatively extensive, the evidence at hand from the Umawī and the early ʿAbbāsī periods is too limited to fully demonstrate that a) the Shākiriyya units denote Turks and b) that these allegedly Turkish units performed their service for the ʿAbbāsī caliphs according to concepts and practices derived from the Central Asian steppe.},

Iraq was the wealthiest province of the empire, and had been undergoing a process of agricultural development since the Umayyad period. Al-Mahdi's decade-long reign was by all accounts a prosperous time for the caliphate. When the Abbasid succession passed on to Harun al-Rashid, it was finally the anticipated moment which different factions wanted. After achieving reconciliation with the Abbasid family and granting amnesty to former opponents in Baghdad, al-Mamun dispatched Abd Allah ibn Tahir on the mission of reunification. Just as al-Mamun's political achievements radically transformed the Abbasid government, his religious policies were equally new and daring.},

This article demonstrates the adaption of WGCNA to mine an entire genre of literature, describing its dominant features, exposing its evolution through time, and dissecting its plot structures. WGCNA not only finds these large-scale structures, but exposes the fine-grained contribution of individual words. Romance accounts for 16.7\% of all novels sold in the USA, and is the most popular form of genre literature (Romance Writers of America, 2013; Industry Statistics. http://www.rwa.org/p/cm/ld/fid=580 (accessed 13 June 2013)). Selling into 111 different markets and thirty-one languages, Harlequin is the largest publisher of romance worldwide, and its most successful category line, Harlequin Presents, offers the reader ‘pure romantic fantasy’ (Harlequin Presents Writing Guidelines)—romance in an almost archetypal sense. Despite the popularity, ubiquity and profitability of category romance, there is relatively little study to date on the phenomenon. Using WGCNA together with all electronically available Harlequin Presents novels—some 1,400 from 1999 to 2013—this article demonstrates that the genre’s fundamental architecture is a choir of authorial voices, that its evolution is dominated by sudden shifts due to financial pressures on the publisher, and that the order in which elements appear—the plot—is largely fixed.},

  abstract = {The story of how Arab editors of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries revolutionized Islamic literatureIslamic book culture dates back to late antiquity, when Muslim scholars began to write down their doctrines on parchment, papyrus, and paper and then to compose increasingly elaborate analyses of, and commentaries on, these ideas. Movable type was adopted in the Middle East only in the early nineteenth century, and it wasn't until the second half of the century that the first works of classical Islamic religious scholarship were printed there. But from that moment on, Ahmed El Shamsy reveals, the technology of print transformed Islamic scholarship and Arabic literature.In the first wide-ranging account of the effects of print and the publishing industry on Islamic scholarship, El Shamsy tells the fascinating story of how a small group of editors and intellectuals brought forgotten works of Islamic literature into print and defined what became the classical canon of Islamic thought. Through the lens of the literary culture of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Arab cities—especially Cairo, a hot spot of the nascent publishing business—he explores the contributions of these individuals, who included some of the most important thinkers of the time. Through their efforts to find and publish classical literature, El Shamsy shows, many nearly lost works were recovered, disseminated, and harnessed for agendas of linguistic, ethical, and religious reform.Bringing to light the agents and events of the Islamic print revolution, Rediscovering the Islamic Classics is an absorbing examination of the central role printing and its advocates played in the intellectual history of the modern Arab world.},

It consisted of certain items: some real estate, but primarily jewelry and domestic goods.

Women ruled, with more or less variety and fantasy, the furniture of the house which was used not only for rest and sleep, but also as a venue for receiving guests. /// 449 inventaires après décès damascènes, vers 1700, aident à aborder un sujet qui s'inscrit dans les gender studies, en permettant la comparaison entre le monde féminin et le monde masculin, dans le domaine économique, social, voire culturel.

We have first to identify the appropriate type of model for the system under consideration and then to tailor it to the specifics of the case. To understand settlement formation, which is the concern of this paper, this not only involves choosing input parameter values such as site separations but also input functions which characterises the ease of travel between sites. Although the generic behaviour of the model is understood, the details are not. Different choices will necessarily lead to different outputs (for identical inputs). We can only proceed if choices that are `close' give outcomes that are similar. Where there are local differences it suggests that there was no compelling reason for one outcome rather than the other. If these differences are important for the historic record we may interpret this as sensitivity to contingency. We re-examine the rise of Greek city-states as first formulated by Rihll and Wilson in 1979, initially using the same `retail' gravity model. We suggest that, whereas cities like Athens owe their position to a combination of geography and proximity to other sites, the rise of Thebes is the most contingent, whose success reflects social forces outside the grasp of simple network modelling.},

Findings are connected to the discussion in institutional economics and economic history concerning the importance of institutional developments in long-distance trade for economic growth in medieval Europe, the efficiency of self-enforcing institutions, and the divergence of institutional arrangements in medieval maritime trade. Finally, both potentials and limitations of agent-based models for historical research are discussed.},

The break with the still widespread positivistic concept of Quellenforschung is overdue since its value for the understanding of literary works is questionable. The interpretation of any work of literature, which includes historiography, has to start with the analysis of the structures of the work in its transmitted form. A biographical work, such as ibn Khallikan's Wafayat al-A'yan, is composed of individual biographies, which can be broken down into smaller units: strictly biographical parts and narrative units (anecdotes and aphorisms). A literary critic trying to understand and explain the biographical work must begin with the analysis of these small narrative units, and from there proceed to the work as a whole, and only then to its place in history.},

Drawing on the abundant historical literature, many recent studies have examined the social impacts of climate change in China during the past 2000 years. This paper reviews the main progress of these studies in three parts. First, a concept model based on the food security in relation to global climate change has been constructed, which can then be used to interpret impact-response processes of climate change in the history of China. Second, we derive a methodology for quantifying the impact of historical climate change, drawing on a series of 4 key social and economic sequences at a 10-year resolution. These have been reconstructed based on the semantic differential method over the past 2000 years in China. Third, using a variety of statistical analyses, we update the understanding of climate impacts throughout the history of China. The overall impacts of climate were negative in the cold periods and positive in the warm periods, at decadal to centennial scales during Chinese history. However, the impacts seemed a mixed blessing both in the cold or warm periods. The social-economic development and population growth in warm periods would intensify the natural resource shortage and disequilibria in the human-environment system, especially when encountering abrupt climate changes. Adaptation to adverse climate change could not only help people to avoid hardship whilst maximizing profits, but also expanded the capabilities for the continual development of Chinese civilization.},

In replacing social history as the dominant new prospective on the past, cultural historians tried to address some of the serious questions raised about the methods of social historians while they adopted the new subjects that social historians had brought into the field. In their revised strategies, cultural historians brought back into awareness issues relating to the contingent, the personal, and the eccentric. At the same time, in swinging away from the vigorous research methods and forms of disciplined inquiry that had become the hallmarks of social historians, cultural historians frequently fell into a variety of problems that have now become quite visible in the field. By urging that the close alliance between cultural and social history be refreshed, Paula Fass suggests ways in which contemporary cultural historians can strengthen their research and writing by learning from the methods and strategies of social history.},

There were two different periods in the history of Farghana under the Samanids. During the first period (till 916), Farghana was an independent, hereditary dominion ruled by the Farghanan branch of the Samanids. It was founded by Aḥmad b. Asad. His sons (Asad, Isḥāq) and grandsons (Nūḥ, Aḥmad and Muḥammad, sons of Asad, and Muḥammad, son of Isḥāq) also ruled Farghana (or part of it). The Samanids in Farghana minted as independent rulers and only the sixth of them, Muḥammad b. Asad, mentioned the head of the dynasty on his coins (in 915-16). The Samanids of Farghana several times rebelled against the central government. During the second period (924-91), Farghana was a province of the Samanid state, where governors of non-Samanid origin ruled the towns (or all of Farghana), granted to them by the Samanid Amīrs as appanages for their service. Most of these governors were Turkish generals who rose to power from the rank and file of the ghulāms (slave soldiers) of the Palace Guard in the capital.},

The chapter focuses on the ways in which developments in local intellectual and cultural histories between 1500 and 1800 reflect localisations of Islam in the region as well as the engaged involvement of South-East Asian Muslims within a global, cosmopolitan community of Islamic religious scholarship. Over the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, a distinct style of regional Islamicate culture developed on the north Java coast (pesisir) in which elements from the traditions of Muslim South Asia and the Middle East, as well as from China and diverse areas of the Indonesian archipelago were combined with local traditions.},

Using Chinese historical literature as well as stone inscriptions, a total of five historical saline lake bodies which had existed in this region were documented: Lakes Yanchize, Xiluchi, Dongluchi, Zhuyanze and Xiaoyanchi. Lakes Zhuyanze, Yanchize, Xiluchi, Dongluchi, and Xiaoyanchi desiccated respectively at some point during 1076–1701 AD, 1584–1735 AD, 1666–1791 AD, 1666–1791 AD, and 1712–1906 AD. The lakes in the west of this region possibly desiccated relatively early, and the lakes in the east desiccated relatively late. Most of the lakes desiccated during a cold climate period. It seems that the dry period of the 15th–17th centuries overlapped with the periods that some of the lakes desiccated. All the five lakes desiccated during periods of increased soil erosion. The main causes of the degradation and desiccation of Lakes Yanchize, Xiluchi and Dongluchi were flood irrigation and silt sedimentation. The degradation and desiccation of Lake Yanchize and Lakes Dongluchi and Xiluchi corresponded to periods of population explosion when land was heavily cultivated in Fuping and Pucheng Counties. The existence of historical saline lakes indicates that the remains of the Sanmen Paleo-Lake existed in the Guanzhong Basin during the past 2000 years.},

The model provides an innovative approach to establishing the optimal distribution of cognitive labor in scientific communities, using an epistemic landscape. In the paper, we provide a critical examination of ELM. First, we show that the computing mechanism for ELM is correct insofar as we are able to replicate the results using another programming language. Second, we show that small changes in the rules that determine the behavior of individual agents can lead to important changes in simulation results. Accordingly, we claim that ELM results are robust with respect to the computing mechanism, but not necessarily across parameter space. We conclude by reflecting on the possible lessons to be gained from ELM as a class of simulations or cluster of models.},

Venetians applied the notion of sexual innocence to both children and adolescents well before the eighteenth century. Through an analysis of criminal investigations from the repositories of the Executors of the Bestemmia and the Council of Forty during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, the essay illustrates the ways in which Venetian authorities, parish priests, and members of the city's neighborhood communities attempted to shelter youth from exposure to adult sexual behavior. Within the spheres of public and clandestine prostitution, the intimacy of the domestic hearth, and the neighborhood streets, judicial authorities, relying on the testimonies of eye witnesses, removed youth in danger from their homes and places of work, punishing prostitutes, exploitative parents, and sexual predators. While formal laws defined minority and majority age and cognizance of right and wrong in gendered terms, ordinary Venetians were more casual about age than legal theorists and expressed a strong aversion toward the sexual perils surrounding youth of both sexes from their childhood years to well into their teens.},

Taking data from Czech, an inflected language, in which the most optimal conditions to respond to this research question are met, the book expands the understanding of language and text in ways that have not been executed before. For predominantly English-based quantitative research, this volume fills a crucial gap by examining the relationship between inflection and other phenomena (including discourse, translation and literature). For the current qualitative research, the volume provides large empirical data to confirm some of its claims, but more importantly, it demonstrates the important role of detailed grammatical concepts that have not been considered before. Besides addressing fundamental questions about text analysis methods, the volume presents a diverse array of Czech data that are unique in their own right and worthy of dissemination to the general audience. Taming the Corpus: From Inflection and Lexis to Interpretation is divided into three sections. Section 1 deals with phonotactics, poetic structure, morphological complexity used to differentiate literary style, and native speakers’ sense of grammaticality – issues pertinent to linguistic typology, cognition and language, and literary studies. Section 2 focuses on inter-language relations, especially the theory of translation. Section 3 demonstrates how quantitative analysis of texts can contribute to our understanding of society and connects the volume to legal language, construction of gender and discourse position and implicit ideology.},

Ibn Tūmart's movement can be understood within its Berber context, in which a charismatic figure with a religious message provided the glue by which tribes were united in a common enterprise leading to state formation. As for al-Andalus, Almoravid rule had been seriously weakened as a result of Christian expansion and of the concentration on fighting the Almohads in the Maghrib.

  abstract = {What do the geographical areas included in this volume have in common over a period reaching from the fifth/eleventh to the twelfth/eighteenth century that would give meaning to both the periodisation and the geographical subdivisions used here? As noted in their introduction by the editors of volume 3 of the New Cambridge history of Islam (The eastern Islamic world, fifth/eleventh to twelfth/eighteenth centuries), a certain degree of arbitrariness always accompanies the need to make temporal and territorial divisions. The obvious Mediterranean articulation of the political and commercial trends dealt with in this volume should not obscure the deep connections that linked the western and eastern Islamic worlds – their populations, their religious and political concepts and practices, and their economies. It is also obvious that the encounter, not to say clash, with the two great civilisations of India and China mostly affected the eastern regions of the Islamic world, while the encounter and clash with Christendom had a deeper impact on the western Islamic regions. But here again things were not as simple as may appear. The westward diffusion of tea from China can be used to exemplify the often convoluted paths through which links between different areas were established. Having been used in the Chinese empire for centuries, tea was not introduced into Iran until the eleventh/seventeenth century; yet it was not from there that it crossed into the Ottoman lands.},

This corpus, which I call the ‘ProppLearner’ corpus, was assembled to provide data for an algorithm designed to learn Vladimir Propp’s morphology of Russian hero tales. The corpus is the most deeply annotated narrative corpus available at this time. The algorithm and learning results are described elsewhere; here, I provide detail on the layers of annotation and how they were chosen, novel layers of annotation required for successful learning, the selection of the texts for annotation, the annotation process itself, and the resulting inter-annotator agreement measures. In particular, the corpus comprised fifteen texts totaling 18,862 words. There were eighteen layers of annotation, five of which were developed specifically to support learning Propp’s morphology: referent attributes, context relationships, event valences, Propp’s ‘dramatis personae’, and Propp’s functions. All annotations were created by trained annotators with the Story Workbench annotation tool, following a double-annotation paradigm. I discuss lessons learned from this effort and what they mean for future digital humanities efforts when working with the semantics of natural language text.},

We offer an empirical, encyclopaedic approach to historical semantics regarding ‘conceptual history’, i.e. the history of concepts that shape thought, culture and society in a particular period. We relate the project to traditional work in conceptual and semantic history and define our object of study as the discursive concept, a category of meaning encoded linguistically as a cluster of expressions that co-occur in discourse. We describe our principal data source, EEBO-TCP, and introduce our key research interests, namely, the contexts of conceptual change, the semantic structure of lexical fields and the nature of lexicalisation pressure. We outline our computational processes, which build upon the theoretical definition of discursive concepts, to discover the linguistically encoded forms underpinning the discursive concepts we seek to identify in EEBO-TCP. Finally, we share preliminary results via a worked example, exploring the discursive contexts in which paradigmatic terms of key cultural concepts emerge. We consider the extent to which particular genres, discourses and users in the early modern period make paradigms, and examine the extent to which these contexts determine the characteristics of key concepts.},

Recent trends in digital research tools and methods have tended to deemphasize the quantitative and objective character of textual study, and instead have focused on an understanding of the digital text as an intellectual model, and digital tools as ways of exploring and interpreting that model. This is true both for textual analysis tools, which have adopted a rhetoric of interpretive richness and open-ended play, and for digital editing, in which readerly enablement and editorial interpretation are at the forefront. In both domains, though, there are internal tensions: for textual analysis, the question of how the text is constituted and how far we are willing to relinquish evidentiary claims; for digital editing, the question of how to accommodate a rhetoric of “fidelity” and “accuracy” to the goals of interpretive power and readerly choice.},

The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context.

The Ottomans also advanced southwards, raiding in Epiros and Albania. In the Peloponnese, the Ottomans advanced successfully under the Ottoman commander Evrenos.

The Ottoman army had become an efficient fighting machine, able to lay siege effectively and to defeat the enemy in formal battles.

We have found that Doha in its urban layout, physical development, architecture, and pre-oil demographics, combined its disparate cosmopolitan elements into a blend that probably typified the historic Gulf town, simultaneously encapsulating aspects of the generalised “Arab and Islamic town.” We have found strong structural principles at work in both the traditional and the early modern town, many of which correlate strongly with tribal social organisation, although the historic population of Doha was neither overwhelmingly tribal in character nor entirely Arab in origin. Rather, these constituted prevailing ideologies, social structures, and identities in a diverse and cosmopolitan population},

It offers comparative evidence from eastern Iran to support the suggestion that this was a funerary monument built for a Ghūrid patron in the late twelfth century and discusses the tomb in relation to other extant Ghūrid structures in South Asia. It emphasizes the degree of regional continuity in Ghūrid architecture by highlighting aspects of the building's design that are also present in the pre-Ghūrid Buddhist and Hindu architecture of the Indus Valley but absent in the medieval monuments of eastern Iran or western India. Accounting for the transculturation to which the tomb bears witness, the author draws attention to the mutual receptivity of eastern Iranian and South Asian architecture in the late twelfth century.},

  abstract = {Universities around the world have increasingly turned to digital infrastructures as a way to revamp the arts and humanities. This article contributes a fresh understanding by examining the material development of HumlabX, a research laboratory for digital humanities at Umeå University, Sweden. Specifically, we approach the empirical case as a timeline of research funding, projects, events, and deliverables to examine how the research laboratory as an organizational and material space developed and evolved in relation to new technology investments. Based on our analysis, we argue that while digital research infrastructures can, indeed, stimulate innovation in and around research, aimed to produce new knowledge, digital technologies carry social and material implications that affect organizational processes. We show that while knowledge production processes at HumlabX were highly influenced by the infrastructural legacy of the past, they indeed directed scholars toward innovation. By discussing these implications in detail, we move beyond the debate of humanities qua digital, and demonstrate the need for scholars of digital humanities to engage in the development of policies for digital research infrastructures. Using a Swedish case study, we argue that research laboratories for the digital humanities must be scrutinized and should be fully exposed as socio-material organizations that develop, and should develop, over time. In particular, we stress the need to ensure that digital humanities laboratories are sustainable and open for redevelopment.},

International Perspectives on Publishing Platforms: Image, Object, Text offers a unique contribution to the field of periodical studies, while also broadening the scope of purview to consider related content with regards to other relevant printed matter and cultural products, as well as digital archiving strategies. Including interdisciplinary contributions from academics around the world, the volume presents a wide range of approaches to periodicals and printed matter from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Questions of material print culture and the digital realm are considered both via theoretical and more empirical approaches. As a whole, the book considers the pluralism of perspectives that the study of periodicals and printed matter contribute to our historical understanding of various political and social issues, and also devotes attention to the ways in which digital archiving projects can be instrumentalized as a strategy for filling in gaps in the historical record. International Perspectives on Publishing Platforms should be of great interest to researchers, academics and postgraduates engaged in the study of periodicals, publishing, book history, world literature, digital humanities, media, visual and material culture},

This article describes an approach for detecting the sorts of intertexts that literary scholars have found most meaningful, as embodied in the free Tesserae website http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/. Tests of Tesserae Versions 1 and 2 showed that word-level n-gram matching could recall a majority of parallels identified by scholarly commentators in a benchmark set. But these versions lacked precision, so that the meaningful parallels could be found only among long lists of those that were not meaningful. The Version 3 search described here adds a second stage scoring system that sorts the found parallels by a formula accounting for word frequency and phrase density. Testing against a benchmark set of intertexts in Latin epic poetry shows that the scoring system overall succeeds in ranking parallels of greater significance more highly, allowing site users to find meaningful parallels more quickly. Users can also choose to adjust both recall and precision by focusing only on results above given score levels. As a theoretical matter, these tests establish that lemma identity, word frequency, and phrase density are important constituents of what make a phrase parallel a meaningful intertext.},

  abstract = {\mbox\mbox This volume debuts the new scope of Remote Sensing, which was first defined as the analysis of data collected by sensors that were not in physical contact with the objects under investigation (using cameras, scanners, and radar systems operating from spaceborne or airborne platforms). A wider characterization is now possible: Remote Sensing can be any non-destructive approach to viewing the buried and nominally invisible evidence of past activity. Spaceborne and airborne sensors, now supplemented by laser scanning, are united using ground-based geophysical instruments and undersea remote sensing, as well as other non-invasive techniques such as surface collection or field-walking survey. Now, any method that enables observation of evidence on or beneath the surface of the earth, without impact on the surviving stratigraphy, is legitimately within the realm of Remote Sensing. \mbox The new interfaces and senses engaged in Remote Sensing appear throughout the book. On a philosophical level, this is about the landscapes and built environments that reveal history through place and time. It is about new perspectives—the views of history possible with Remote Sensing and fostered in part by immersive, interactive 3D and 4D environments discussed in this volume. These perspectives are both the result and the implementation of technological, cultural, and epistemological advances in record keeping, interpretation, and conceptualization. Methodology presented here builds on the current ease and speed in collecting data sets on the scale of the object, site, locality, and landscape. As this volume shows, many disciplines surrounding archaeology and related cultural studies are currently involved in Remote Sensing, and its relevance will only increase as the methodology expands.},

By dispossessing his enemies-who were depicted as the arch-enemies of Sunni Islam-Saladin succeeded in collecting estates, farm land, houses and buildings that in the past were owned by the Fatimids, Armenians and Franks. This property was endowed by him to support the new Islamic institutions he founded in Cairo and Jerusalem.},

The tax burden for an average Muslim was an alms-tax of about 2-10 per cent of his revenue, and another tax levied on his land, which could be either the tithe of the revenue off his Muslim land, or the land-tax levied on newly occupied land. Even though many aspects of early Islamic taxation are subject to debate, there is no doubt about who eventually used up most of the levied tax: the military. Large-scale use of Turkish slave soldiers restricted the Arabs' influence to the civil sector, which was a considerable price to pay. In Egypt the combination of military slavery and iqṭā reached its peak after the ascension of the Mamlūk dynasty. The Ottoman empire had emerged out of the bankrupt Saljuq empire in western Anatolia at the end of the seventh/thirteenth century.},

The application of software to assist in the analysis of large collections of data does not just expand the volume of material we can incorporate in our work, it also expands how we in the humanities understand the nature of meaning. The recent scholarly turn to the expanded modes of analysis made possible by DH is not just the “latest new thing” but gives the scholarly community a way to articulate and respond to long-standing doubts about the epistemological grounding in the practice of the humanities. Even more importantly, I believe that this broadening of inquiry afforded by DH is intrinsic to the humanistic project itself. In this essay, I seek in particular to connect the implicit conceptual substructure behind the architectural logic of the digital humanities to key strains of hermeneutic thought that have established a basis for exploring the question of how we are to understand the vast, variegated world of historical human experience that is the object of our humanistic inquiries across disciplines.},

In the present article, all the patterns of predictable lexical ambiguity in Modern Greek Language are registered, verified and quantified as occurred in the Neurolingo computational lexicon, after a study of morpho-syntactic characteristics that differentiate the ambiguous words.},

The major products from the 13-hydroperoxide isomer were identified as the corresponding monohydroxydienoic acid derivative, threo-11-hydroxy-trans12,13-epoxy-octadec-cis9-enoic acid and 9,12,13-trihydroxy-octadec-trans10-enoic acid. The corresponding products from the 9-hydroperoxide were the monohydroxydienoic acid, 9,10-epoxy-11-hydroxy-octadec-12-enoic acid and 9,10,13-trihydroxy-octadec-11-enoic acid. 4. No separation of activities forming the different products was achieved by partial purification of enzyme extracts. 5. Product formation was unaffected by EDTA, CN-, sulphydryl reagents or glutathione but was reduced by boiling the extracts. 6. This system is compared with the 9-hydroperoxide-specific enzymic formation of divinyl ether derivatives by potato extracts.},

The notions of ‘intertextuality’, ‘transtextuality’, and ‘hypertextuality/hypotextuality’ were introduced in the seventies and eighties to approach these phenomena. Through the Phœbus project, computer scientists from the computer science laboratory of the University Pierre and Marie Curie collaborate with the literary teams of Paris-Sorbonne University to develop efficient tools for literary studies that take advantage of modern computer science techniques to detect borrowings of huge masses of texts and to help put them in context. In this context, we have developed a piece of software that automatically detects and explores networks of textual reuses in classical literature. This article describes the principles on which our program is based, the significant results that have already been obtained and the prospective for the near future. It is divided into four parts. The first part recalls the distinction between various types of borrowings like plagiarism, pastiches, citations, etc. The second enumerates the criteria that are retained to characterize reuses and citations on which we are focusing here. The third part describes the implementation and shows its efficiency by comparison with manual detection. Finally, we show some of the results that have already been obtained with the Phœbus program.},

  abstract = {"Preface This book has its genesis in my PhD research at the London School of Economics. I started the degree with questions about the 2008/09 financial crisis and planned to spend most of my time researching about capital adequacy requirements. But I quickly realized much of my time would actually be spent learning the day-to-day tasks of data gathering, analysis, and results presentation. After plodding through for awhile, the breaking point came while reentering results into a regression table after I had tweaked one of my statistical models, yet again. Surely there was a better way to do research that would allow me to spend more time answering my research questions. Making research reproducible for others also means making it better organized and efficient for yourself. So, my search for a better way led me straight to the tools for reproducible computational research. The reproducible research community is very active, knowledgeable and helpful. Nonetheless, I often encountered holes in this collective knowledge, or at least had no resource to bring it all together as a whole. That is my intention for this book: to bring together the skills I have picked up for actually doing and presenting computational research. Hopefully, the book along with making reproducible research more common, will save researchers hours of Googling, so they can spend more time addressing their research questions. I would not have been able to write this book without many people's advice and support. Foremost is John Kimmel, acquisitions editor at Chapman \& Hall. He approached me with in Spring 2012 with the general idea and opportunity for this book"--},

Climate extremes are sharp, strong and sometimes protracted periods of cooling and drought caused by volcanic eruptions that in this case resulted in a negative effect on the economy of a nomadic society and were often accompanied by famine and illness. In fact, many of these natural catastrophes coincided with the Black Death pandemics among the Eastern Turks and the Chinese living in the north of China. The Turk Empire can be split into several chronological periods during which significant events that led to changes in the course of history of the nomadic state took place: AD 534–545—the rise of the Turk Empire; AD 581–583—the division of the Turk Empire into the Western and the Eastern Empires; AD 601–603—the rise of Qimin Qaghan; AD 627–630—the Eastern Turks are conquered by China; AD 679–687—the second rise of the Eastern Turk Empire. The research shows that there is clearly-discernable interplay between important historical events and climate extremes in the history of the Turk Empire. This interplay has led us to the conclusion that the climatic factor did have an impact on the historical processes that took place in the eastern part of Inner Asia, especially on the territories with a nomadic economy.},

The Islamic empire was beginning to witness the loss of Muslim territory, at the hands of either Spanish Catholics or Russian Orthodox Christians, and a reverse flow of conversion from Islam to Christianity. The territory under Muslim rule, or dār al-islām, can be divided into two parts: the frontier regions and the Muslim heartland. In the middle of the fifth/eleventh century, Asia Minor and the Balkans were entirely Christian. Yet by the middle of the tenth/sixteenth century, Muslims constituted the great majority of the population in Asia Minor and an important minority in the Balkans.},

The Afghans were to rule Iran for only seven years, and represented a transitional interlude from the Safavids to the Afshars, the second of the four eighteenth-century dynasties. Iran's centre of power was shifted east towards Central Asia, and as a consequence significant Sunni population was incorporated into what until then had been a largely Shii state. The impact of Europeans on Iran's economy had begun to be felt in the Safavid era, but the force of Europe's military and political power and rivalries, combined with European economic interests, took on ever-greater importance at the beginning of the nineteenth century.},

Inoculation of different trypanosome strains into volunteers yielded positive parasitaemia for original isolates from lion, hyaena, and Coke's hartebeest.

Tests with trypanosomes originating from experimentally mixed T. b. rhodesiense and brucei infections gave inconsistent results.

However, despite its historical and critical importance, neither the features nor the precise historical development of this shift has been the subject of systematic analysis. In this essay, we undertake an in-depth analysis of one key feature of what became known as the colloquial style: patterns of linguistic repetition. With the aid of quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of repetition is in itself a reliable metric for automatically detecting the presence of colloquial discourse. We find that colloquial repetition does indeed increase in American fiction over the course of the 19th and early 20th century, but, via comparative analysis, that this phenomenon may not be limited to American prose. Finally, we explore the semantics of these patterns of repetition, demonstrating first that repetition is broadly characteristic of represented speech in writing, and secondly that changes over time in the semantic contents of repetitions demonstrate a clear increase in colloquial, informal language.},

  abstract = {Les recherches sur le soufisme souffrent souvent d’une fâcheuse dichotomie. En effet, les unes privilégient une approche philologique centrée sur l’analyse intemporelle des doctrines ; les autres, usant des outils de l’historien, du sociologue ou de l’anthropologue, s’attachent surtout à fournir des phénomènes religieux étudiés une explication locale, mais ne sont pas assez attentives aux « traits permanents de la spiritualité en islam ». En donnant pour cadre à son travail l’islam syro-égyptien à une époque charnière de son histoire, Eric Geoffroy évite à la fois le minimalisme décevant de monographies trop étroites et le flou artistique de synthèses trop larges. Il est constamment soucieux, d’autre part, de confronter « temporel et intemporel », « histoire et métahistoire ». De ce point de vue, sa thèse apparaît donc comme une contribution significative aux efforts de tous ceux qui se préoccupent d’associer des démarches dont la cohabitation, aussi rare que féconde, conduit à remettre en cause des clichés régulièrement dénoncés mais dotés encore d’une extraordinaire résilience.  Appuyé sur l’examen scrupuleux et pénétrant de multiples sources, dont beaucoup demeurent manuscrites, cet ouvrage, écrit dans une langue ferme et claire, présente la vie religieuse - et pas seulement du soufisme stricto sensu -, à la fin de l’époque mamelouke et au début de l’ère ottomane, un tableau riche de nuances.  En définitive, c’est à bon droit qu’Eric Geoffroy affirme à la fin de son ouvrage que, sous toutes ses formes, les plus hautes ou les plus populaires, le tasawwuf occupe dans l’époque qu’il décrit une position « centrale et dominante ».

  abstract = {This volume is a collection of several papers devoted to Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyūṭī (d. 911/1505), presented on the First Conference of the School of Mamlūk Studies (held at Ca' Foscari University, Venice, from June 23 to June 25, 2014). It aims to contribute to a reassessment of the scholarly profile of the controversial but fascinating polymath and intellectual, and, more generally, to a deeper understanding of the cultural, political and academic life of the last period of the Mamlūk empire. Jalāl al-Dīn al-Suyūṭī's bibliography ranges from law to theology, and from linguistics to history. It includes medicine and geography. He felt that his mission was to preserve the rich cultural heritage of the past, and knowledge in general, from widespread ignorance and decline. Considered for a long time to be an author devoid of any originality and a "simple" compiler, this polymath was in fact an excellent teacher and a rigorous scholar who had a meticulous and accurate working method. With contributions by: Christopher D. Bahl; Mustafa Banister; Joel Blecher; Stephen R. Burge; Daniela Rodica Firanescu; Éric Geoffroy; Antonella Ghersetti; Francesco Grande; Jaakko Hämeen-Anttila; Takao Ito; Judith Kindinger; Christian Mauder; Aaron Spevack},

This paper uses data on about 100 nations to address this aspect, focusing on the long, medium and short-term research intensity. Across two measures of a nation's institutional history, we find that broader national stability positively affects research intensity both in the long and the medium terms, while the narrower path dependence measure supports these findings, albeit with weak statistical significance. The effects on short-term research intensity lack statistical support across both measures. Comparing institutional path dependence with research inertia, we find that both factors significantly affect research intensity. The main findings are robust to various modifications.},

The study resulted in a rich collection of different types of graphics, data provenance, and relationships between text, graphics, and data. Based on this corpus, we present a systematic overview of word-scale graphic designs, and examine how designers used them. We also discuss the designers’ goals in creating their graphics, and characterize how they used word-scale graphics to visualize data, add emphasis, and create alternative narratives. Building on these examples, we discuss implications for the design of authoring tools for word-scale graphics and visualizations, and explore how new authoring environments could make it easier for designers to integrate them into documents.},

In this magisterial work, Goldthwaite brings together a lifetime of research and insight on the subject, clarifying and explaining the complex workings of Florence's commercial, banking, and artisan sectors. Florence was one of the most industrialized cities in medieval Europe, thanks to its thriving textile industries. The importation of raw materials and the exportation of finished cloth necessitated the creation of commercial and banking practices that extended far beyond Florence's boundaries. Part I situates Florence within this wider international context and describes the commercial and banking networks through which the city's merchant-bankers operated. Part II focuses on the urban economy of Florence itself, including various industries, merchants, artisans, and investors. It also evaluates the role of government in the economy, the relationship of the urban economy to the region, and the distribution of wealth throughout the society. While political, social, and cultural histories of Florence abound, none focuses solely on the economic history of the city. The Economy of Renaissance Florence offers both a systematic description of the city's major economic activities and a comprehensive overview of its economic development from the late Middle Ages through the Renaissance to 1600},

There was no expectation that they be performed. Even in Galileo's dialogues, the distinction between real experiments and imaginary ones is not sharp (see galileo). During the seventeenth century, performance and public description became essential to the probative power of experiment. These made its methods and procedures transparent, allowing any reader of the narrative to be a virtual witness of an active demonstration (Shapin and Schaffer 1985, pp. 22?79). Thus, by the end of the scientific revolution, illustrative narratives were distinguished from public accounts of experiment as the disciplined, systematic study of phenomena. Eventually this made the efficacy of thought experiments problematic (see Kuhn 1977, pp. 241?2, and thought experiments). As a source of experience of realms previously beyond the reach of the senses, real?world experiment contributed to the rise of objective scientific knowledge. Harvey, Galileo, Hooks, Boyle, Newton, and other proponents of experimental natural philosophy established an important new mode of argumentation.},

This study examines sets of quantitative and qualitative data to explore the usage of MONK as a research tool: the author analyzes eighteen months of web analytics data from the MONK website and responses from five interviews with MONK users to examine the ways in which MONK has been most commonly used by researchers. In the paper's analysis, the author considers the implications of MONK's use in digital humanities research and teaching, and how a digital humanities tool such as MONK can be maintained for public use. This study ultimately explores how user studies of digital humanities tools can reveal insights into humanities scholars' needs for using digital tools to pursue new research methodologies, and argues that studying the usability and preservation of digital humanities tools will enable information professionals to address humanities scholars' needs for their digital scholarship.},

Harley is in town to work with the local Heritage Museum, and Douglas is there to tear down the town's beloved old Bent Bridge, so from day one they are on a collision course; but out of this unpromising union comes something unexpected, something even better than perfection.},

And why is history - especially long-term history - so essential to understanding the multiple pasts which gave rise to our conflicted present? The History Manifesto is a call to arms to historians and everyone interested in the role of history in contemporary society. Leading historians Jo Guldi and David Armitage identify a recent shift back to longer-term narratives, following many decades of increasing specialisation, which they argue is vital for the future of historical scholarship and how it is communicated. This provocative and thoughtful book makes an important intervention in the debate about the role of history and the humanities in a digital age. It will provoke discussion among policymakers, activists and entrepreneurs as well as ordinary listeners, viewers, readers, students and teachers. This title is also available as open access.},

These texts combine the instrumental approach of compiling knowledge for the court with literary traditions in local historiography. This article explores these local geographical writings through theories on identity and space, arguing that these texts reflect the shifting spatial imagination of Persianate elites in the context of rapid social and economic change. These texts are an alternate entry point for viewing the politics of identity in Qājār Iran, challenging the teleological approach to the emergence of nationalism in secondary literature. Taking the close relationship between territory and community as a starting point, this article argues that expressions of regional socio-economic unities, which are a key feature of the geographical writings of Iranian elites, reflect the consolidation of regional identities.},

The tools developed by Interedition’s ‘Prototyping’ working group were tested by other research teams, which formulate strategic recommendations. To this purpose, the Centre for Manuscript Genetics (University of Antwerp), the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands (The Hague), and the University of Würzburg have been working together within the framework of Interedition. One of the concrete results of collaboration is the development and fine-tuning of the text collation tool CollateX.2 In this article, we would like to investigate how the architecture of a digital archive containing modern manuscripts can be designed in such a way that users can autonomously collate textual units of their choice with the help of the collation tool CollateX and thus decide for themselves how efficiently this digital architecture functions—as an archive, as a genetic dossier, or as an edition. The first part introduces CollateX and its internal concepts and heuristics as a tool for digitally supported collation. How this tool can be integrated in the infrastructure of an electronic edition is discussed in part two. The third and final part examines the possibility of deploying CollateX for the collation of modern manuscripts by means of a test case: the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (www.beckettarchive.org).},

Using a prosopographical approach, it focuses on the office of the qāḍī as an intersection of imperial and provincial authority, using the cities of Ḥarrān, al-Raqqa, and al- Mawṣil as case studies. A comparative analysis of the individuals appointed to the qāḍīship reveals some commonalities in their backgrounds, particularly regarding ḥadīth transmission, but also clear differences in the appointment patterns identified for each city. For example, the office of the qāḍī of Ḥarrān seems to have been a predominantly local affair, while Raqqan qāḍīs frequently held transregional elite status. The judges of al-Mawṣil, on the other hand, feature local, regional, and transregional representatives. This variance is likely due to political and administrative factors and emphasizes the complex dynamics and hierarchies of governance in the early Islamic period.},

The article traces the development of the term elite in scholarly discourse from the 19th century onward and presents its own definition suited to the complex organizational structure of early Islamic society, pointing out both the challenges of and possible strategies for studying early Islamic elites.},

Communications depended on landscape and climatic conditions, of course, but a series of major strategic routes connected these different cultural and geographical zones. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that road building and bridge building were on several occasions carried out using the skills of Roman captives during the third and fourth centuries. The city was one of the most important features of the late ancient landscape, both in respect of the social organisation of production and the ownership and control of resources in land and manpower. Cities and urban centres in the Sasanian world occupied a somewhat different role in the structure of the state, although they were similar in respect of some of their social and economic functions.},

  abstract = {Authorship verification is a branch of forensic authorship analysis addressing the following task: Given a number of sample documents of an author A and a document allegedly written by A , the task is to decide whether the author of the latter document is truly A or not. We present a scalable authorship verification method that copes with this problem across different languages, genres and topics. The central concept of our method is a model, which is trained with Dutch, English, Greek, Spanish and German text documents. The model sets for each language specific parameters and a threshold that accepts or rejects the alleged author as A . The proposed method offers a wide range of benefits, e.g., a universal (static) threshold for each language and scalability regarding almost any involved component (classification function, ensemble strategy, features, etc.). Furthermore, the method benefits from low runtime due to the fact that no natural language processing techniques nor other computationally-intensive methods are involved. In our experiments, we applied the method on 28 test corpora including 4525 verification cases across 16 genres and a huge number of mixed topics, where we achieved competitive results (75\% median accuracy). With these results we were able to outperform two state-of-the-art baselines, given the same training and test corpora.},

The book offers a chronological exploration of Byzantium and the outlook of its rulers during the time of the Crusades. It argues that one of the main keys to Byzantine interaction with Western Europe, the Crusades and the crusader states can be found in the nature of the Byzantine Empire and the ideology which underpinned it, rather than in any generalised hostility between the peoples. Taking recent scholarship into account, this new edition includes an updated notes section and bibliography, as well as significant additions to the text: new material on the role of religious differences after 1100, a detailed discussion of economic, social and religious changes that took place in 12th-century Byzantine relations with the west, in-depth coverage of Byzantium and the Crusades during the 13th century, new maps, illustrations, genealogical tables and a timeline of key dates. Byzantium and the Crusades is an important contribution to the historiography by a major scholar in the field that should be read by anyone interested in Byzantine and crusader history"--},

  abstract = {The canon of biblical books is frequently cited as a parallel to a unitary literary canon that, though often presumed, is in fact not to be found. The biblical canon was created for the purpose of forestalling change and exiling competition. There are at least ten kinds of literary canons, all ultimately resulting from selections made for such distinct purposes as providing models, transmitting a heritage, creating common frames of reference, logrolling, legitimating theory, historicizing, and pluralizing. Canons formed for any of these purposes necessarily yield to change over time and compete with one another at any given time. We can reasonably expect neither the abolition of selective canons nor agreement on a single one; we can, however, seek clarity about purposes.},

  abstract = {The sociological dimensions of the development of a sectarian orientation in early Imami Shiʿism have remained sparsely explored since Marshall Hodgson posed the question ‘How did the early Shia become sectarian?’ in 1955. This article explores Imamic hadith statements on the canonical ritual payment of zakāt/ṣadaqa as a way of tracking the crystallisation of communitarian boundaries. It argues that the Shiʿi Imams, especially Imam Bāqir, fit into a common Muslim discourse regarding the payment of zakāt, for example in the case of an unjust Imam. However, the hadiths of the Imam Ṣādiq show a pivot towards the more clearly differentiated Shiʿi juristic positions of the Occultation period. Imamic statements on zakāt, therefore, must be seen as neither identical to Sunni positions, nor to classical Twelver Shiʿi formulations, but rather as dynamic responses to developing circumstances. In using Imamic hadiths to track early Shiʿi doctrine, this article also suggests directions for the development of a methodology for using hadiths to track historical developments, a venture which has barely begun. In dealing with the Shiʿi Hadith corpus, the author calls for an epistemological scepticism, coupled with a methodological positivism, assuming that while Imamic hadiths may merely act as mouthpieces for later doctrinal positions, it is also very possible that they do originate in the circles of the Imams to whom they are ascribed, and should be analysed as such in order to track chronological developments in the Hadith corpus.Keywords: Minorities, sectarianism, Shia, Shiʿism, Hadith, Islamic law, zakāt, ṣadaqa, alms, taxation, charity, group identity},

The second legacy was the Mamlūk occupation of the relatively rich province of Yemen, domination over which meant tax revenues, the effective protection of the Ḥijāz from the south and control of the trade that crossed into the Red Sea.

DH is defined as involuntary, uninhibited detrusor contractions. The physiology and pathophysiology of the micturition reflex is reviewed. The balance between cerebral stimulation and supraspinal inhibition is discussed. DH is caused by disturbances in this balance. Whereas increased afferent impulses to the central nervous system due to local disorders in bladder and/or urethra may produce DH, a neurological disorder affecting the inhibitory nervous pathways from cortical and subcortical centres always result in uninhibited detrusor contractions. DH was found in 25\% of 2000 patients. In the majority of the patients the DH was caused by a neurological disorder. The incidence of DH in patients with enuresis, gynecological patients with urinary incontinence and/or genital prolapse and patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is reported. In 62\% of the patients with BPH the DH was eliminated after adequate surgical treatment of the infravesical obstruction. By contrast, DH in women with genital prolapse and/or incontinence persisted despite operative treatment. In a retrospective investigation of 152 patients with DH, the cause of the DH was unknown in 32 patients (21\%). A clinical neurological examination revealed no evidence of neurological disease in 45\% of the 22 patients examined. Voiding symptoms were the only complaint in these patients as well as in 30-40\% of the patients in the other groups mentioned. This calls for improved investigatory methods in the evaluation of the balance between stimulation and inhibition of the micturition reflex. The presence of uninhibited detrusor contractions in apparently healthy patients should indicate a neurological examination since DH may be the first sign of a neurological disorder. The micturition reflex is conducted through long, uninterrupted neurons with a marked central integration. Therefore cystometry may be used as a supplement to the clinical neurological examination in the early diagnosis of pyramidal or extrapyramidal central nervous system disorders.},

If the essential significance of "jihad" as righteous cause (i.e., action for the sake of a moral order) is shown to have been variously altered according to the needs and conditions of the Muslim community, significant possibilities arise for a contemporary understanding of "jihad" that is relevant to the needs and circumstances of the Muslim community today. Some features of the "jihad" tradition, although specific to a particular period and with little relevance today, continue to inform the current discussion on "jihad." Discussion of the "jihad" tradition, then, should take care to distinguish the historically incidental features of the tradition from those with an enduring relevancy. By doing so, the "jihad" tradition will be able to contribute to discussions on the relation of religion to the public order and political organization, even those not limited to Islam.},

  abstract = {This book highlights the quantitative methods of data mining and information visualization and explores their use in relation to the films and writings of the Russian director, Dziga Vertov. The theoretical basis of the work harkens back to the time when a group of Russian artists and scholars, known as the “formalists,” developed new concepts of how art could be studied and measured. This book brings those ideas to the digital age. One of the central questions the book intends to address is, “How can hypothetical notions in film studies be supported or falsified using empirical data and statistical tools?” The first stage involves manual and computer-assisted annotation of the films, leading to the production of empirical data which is then used for statistical analysis but more importantly for the development of visualizations. Studies of this type furthermore shed light on the field of visual presentation of time-based processes; an area which has its origin in the Russian formalist sphere of the 1920s and which has recently gained new relevance due to technological advances and new possibilities for computer-assisted analysis of large and complex data sets. In order to reach a profound understanding of Vertov and his films, the manual or computer-assisted data analysis must be combined with film-historical knowledge and a study of primary sources. In addition, the status of the surviving film materials and the precise analysis of these materials combined with knowledge of historical film technology provide insight into archival policy and political culture in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and 30s.},

After an introduction to legal taxation and Saljī˒q fiscal policy, the philological problems of a specific due, al-fissa, illegitimate according to the shariūa, will be addressed along with its political function, history, levying and transfer. It was levied in Damascus for an annual and/or occasional tribute to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, even before the alliance of Damascus and Jerusalem in 532/1140. Before Nūr al-Dīn Mahmūd's conquest of Damascus the monies were transferred by bearers oihawälas. It can be suggested that tax farmers were liable for them. A decree, rasm, allowed for the collection of al-fissa. The due was levied perhaps on the basis of an assessment of urban real estate. An interpretation of the term al-fissa was suggested as Arabic borrowing from the middle Latin term fossa.},

It probably came into being during the 160s/780s when the 'old market of the caliph Hishām' was transferred from within al-Raqqa to the free land between the two cities. The decision of Hārūn al-Rashīd to reside in al-Raqqa created a new demand, and consequently glass furnaces and pottery kilns were set up for mass production. A road running from the east gate of al-Rāfiqa connected this area. After 198/213 the governor of the west, Ṭāhir ibn al-Ḥusain, erected a wall north of the area in order to protect it from Bedouin raids. During the third/ninth century at the latest the area developed into a third urban entity. Al-Muqaddasī mentions an al-Raqqa al-Muḥtariqa. The identification with the commercial and industrial area is proposed. The decline of al-Raqqa al-Muḥtariqa began in the 270s/880s and 280s/890s. The devastating rule of the Ḥamdânids probably marks its end.},

Money as a means of coordinating human decisions and economic exchange is a complex social invention. Islamic legal theory determined the value of money to be identical with the intrinsic value of the bullion. The Zubayrid governor had targeted the ideological, religious deficiencies of the Umayyad regime. The Ismaili Shiite Fatimids challenged the Abbasid claim of universal rulership both ideologically and militarily, and thus their coinage named only the Fatimid caliph. After their conquest of Egypt their coins presented a visual distinction to the classical late Abbasid coinage, moving towards a design consisting mainly of rings of concentric inscriptions.},

  abstract = {The final centuries BCE (Before Common Era) saw the main focus of trade between the Far East and Europe switch from the so called Northern Route across the Asian steppes to the classical silk roads. The cities across central Asia flourished and grew in size and importance. While clearly there were political, economic and cultural drivers for these changes, there may also have been a role for changes in climate in this relatively arid region of Asia. Analysis of a new ensemble of snapshot global climate model simulations, run every 250 years over the last 6000 years, allows us to assess the long term climatological changes seen across the central Asian arid region through which the classical Silk Roads run. While the climate is comparatively stable through the Holocene, the fluctuations seen in these simulations match significant cultural developments in the region. From 1500 BCE the deterioration of climate from a transient precipitation peak, along with technological development and the immigration of Aryan nomads, drove a shift towards urbanization and probably irrigation, culminating in the founding of the major cities of Bukhara and Samarkand around 700–500 BCE. Between 1000 and 250 BCE the modelled precipitation in the central Asian arid region undergoes a transition towards wetter climates. The changes in the Western Disturbances, which is the key weather system for central Asian precipitation, provides 10\% more precipitation and the increased hydrological resources may provide the climatological foundation for the golden era of Silk Road trade.},

These archival practices were spread across the Mamluk realm and involved numerous actors, which included the central bureaucracy in Cairo, individual secretaries, and, most importantly, the small-scale administration managed by officers.

The issue of space has deeply influenced reflections on periodization as is, evident, for instance, within changed frameworks such as global history and new fields of study, such as Mediterranean or Indian Ocean Studies. For the Middle East, the rise of the concept of Late Antiquity has proven to be a particularly fruitful spatial reconfiguration that has changed established notions of periodization. The second major impact on the questions of periodization has come from changing thematic foci, most importantly, the diversification of historical studies away from the primacy of political history. In the field of Middle Eastern history, this has been particularly pertinent on account of the prominent position that dynastic periodizations have held. Finally, notions of periodization have undergone changes as the question of historical agency has been reconsidered. In the study of non-European history, such changes emerged in particular as an outcome of reflections on the degree to which such societies’ histories followed patterns derived from European models. The article argues that the contributions to this volume open up new venues to think of the question of periodization in Middle Eastern history by taking a long-term perspective from early Islam to the present day.},

  abstract = {This article examines the development of the pharaoh as a literary figure in~Arabic historiography between the third/ninth and the ninth/fifteenth~centuries. The first aim is to reflect upon the changing narrative structure of~such anecdotes in texts ranging from the universal chronicle of al-Ṭabarī~(d. 310/923) to the regional chronicle of al-Maqrīzī (d. 845/1442). The~article’s second concern is to evaluate the plurality of meanings that~emerged from these changes. This discussion is then linked to detailed~consideration of the authors’ social contexts, with particular focus on that~of al-Maqrīzī. The nexus between literary approach and social history that~is proposed here offers a deeper understanding of the function of narrative~resources that moved from text to text. Not only was this a salient feature~of Arabic historiography, but also it allows us to reconsider the repeated appearance of such elements beyond describing them as simply ‘borrowing’ or ‘copying’. Indeed, the discussion concludes that authors~skilfully drew from a pool of narrative devices and artfully established~intertextual allusions across both time and genres.},

For example, what missionary or warlike project of Pope Julius in the Near East prompted the translation and production of a Catholic book of Hours in Arabic? What local usage does the book follow? Or perhaps it follows the Eastern Orthodox usage rather than the Western. These are questions that some scholar may solve in the future. That the book was intended to attract adherents of Islam is clear by the opening lines of the various sections which imitate the beginnings of the sections of the Koran, "In the name of God, the Ever-living, the Eternal," etc. If it were translated into Turkish, it might well be connected with the overtures made by Pope Julius to the Turks shortly before his death, but the Arabic text would seem to preclude that supposition.]},

Corruption of language is our target. Sounding ambiguity in crisis writings versus fictions, we use tools that signal shades of meaning that allow for alternative reading. From Empson (Seven Types of Ambiguity. London: Random House, 2004) seven types of ambiguity, we scouted and built out four we could set up in digital format: (1) vagueness, (2) contronyms, (3) polysemous words, and (4) unusual juxtapositions of words in rum sequences. We feed these markers of ambiguity on a computer-aided text analysis build-out to trace how ambiguity in leaders’ cant changes with time. We marshaled speeches by President Putin and NATO Secretary Rasmussen (Ukrainian crisis), President Medvedev and President Saakashvili (Russian intervention in Georgia), and speeches by President Saddam Hussein. Novels completed the corpus, Henry James’ The Bostonians, and Flaubert’s Sentimental Education and its original French version, L’Éducation Sentimentale. We suspect ambiguity to be diversely at work in each of these data sets. The four markers of ambiguity increase over time in Putin, Saakashvili, and Hussein; they decrease in NATO, Medvedev, and in James and Flaubert. Across the samples, correlations between the four markers are high and significant.},

These narratives often depicted Lutheranism and Calvinism as more modern and more progressive forms of religion, which replaced a decaying and outmoded medieval Catholicism. Because of their interest in religious practices, social historians have been more focused on the similar goals and aims of reformed Protestantism and reformed Catholicism, such as the goal of both to instill greater social and moral discipline in an effort to remake the kingdom of Christ on earth, than in the obvious doctrinal disputes that divided them. These contributions are most noticeable in several key areas--lay piety, rituals, gender and marriage, confessionalization and social discipline, and transmission of ideas through print, images, and education--and the greatest potential for future research lies in these same areas.},

  abstract = {I argue that McGann’s Radiant Textuality (2001), shaped by postmodern literary theory and the nature of electronic texts, is wrong-headed–that McGann’s valorization of the instability of texts and interpretation leads to poor results. It concentrates on three examples: a scanner experiment that leads to the dictum that “no text is self-identical,” a “deformance” of Stevens’s “The Snowman” that results in the claim that the poem is noun-heavy, and a discussion of Joyce Kilmer’s “Trees” that suggests it is a good modernist poem about sex. I claim that, on the contrary, texts are remarkably stable, Stevens uses only an average number of nouns, and “Trees” can be better understood by focusing more closely upon and altering its language. In all three cases, McGann’s approach, because it so consistently points away from the text, provides little insight into the nature of text and interpretation, while a text-centered, language-centered approach is much more illuminating.},

  abstract = {Computational stylistics has often analyzed variations in the style of a single author or text, including chronological change, the dialogue or narration of multiple characters or narrators in a single novel, and other perceived shifts in style. Here, I examine intra-textual style variation from a different perspective, and suggest circumstances under which it is appropriate and beneficial to omit some parts of texts from an analysis to eliminate sources of predictable and intrusive variation that would render other kinds of variation or consistency of style invisible. In other cases it may be appropriate to randomize a text to mask a kind of variation that would otherwise disrupt an analysis. One way to do this is by sorting the lines of the text in random order before analyzing it in sections. In analyses in which texts of very different lengths must be compared, it is also beneficial to randomize the longer parts, cut them all to approximately the length of the shortest one, and use the equalized amounts of text to create a word frequency list that is not biased in favor of the longer parts. These techniques can lead to a deeper understanding of style variation.},

The first section considers book cultures from local, national and global perspectives. Section two, organized around the dynamic relationship between the material book and the mutable text, develops a loosely chronological narrative from early writing, through manuscript and early printing, to the institution of a mechanized book trade, and on to the globalization of publishing and the introduction of the electronic book. A third section takes a practical turn, discussing methods, sources and approaches: bibliographical, archival and reading experience methodologies, as well as pedagogical strategies"--},

Phonetic systems try to respond to the succession of sounds that make up a word, based on the irreducible elements used in speaking. In an ideographic system, each word is represented by a single sign that is unrelated to the sounds of the word itself, but expresses the idea which the word represents. The classic example of an ideographic writing system is Chinese. There is a common misunderstanding that treats each Chinese character as a separate sign. Hanzi (the system of Chinese Characters) serves as a kind of common information carrier created and shared by the whole Chinese society, and as such it is obviously neither disorderly nor unsystematic. On the contrary, there must be some intrinsic laws that make Hanzi the most mature ideographic system in the world. As Complex Network analysis has become an effective tool to analyze complex systems, this article aims to use some of these methods to identify such intrinsic laws of the Hanzi system.},

Roman rule was now only a dim memory, recalled in the ruins of its monuments and in the resurgence of Byzantine military power along Syria's northern borderlands. Syrians might soon come to feel that a relatively stable and tolerant Arab-Muslim government was no worse than the disruption and turmoil of the last decades of Byzantine rule. The symbolic impact of Muslim rule may have been even greater, for the new regime was no longer a Christian commonwealth, a providential vehicle of salvation. The first governor was Abd Allah ibn Ali, the powerful uncle of al-Saffah and al-Mansur who had led the victorious Abbasid armies into Syria. In the late third/ninth century Syria suddenly entered on an era of sustained turbulence, in common with many parts of the Islamic world.},

Using a Variable Length n-Gram Feature Extraction Algorithm, principal component analysis and average linkage clustering we are able to show that 24 sutras, attributed by the tradition to different translators, were in fact translated by the same translator or group of translators. Since part of our method is based on assigning weight to n-grams, the analysis is capable of yielding distinctive features, i.e. strings of Chinese characters, that are characteristic of the translator(s). This is the first time that these techniques have successfully been applied to medieval Chinese texts. The results of this study open up a number of new directions for the lexicographic and syntactic study of early Chinese translations of Buddhist texts.},

  abstract = {The Arabic philosophical fable Hayy Ibn Yaqzan is a classic of medieval Islamic philosophy. Ibn Tufayl (d. 1185), the Andalusian philosopher, tells of a child raised by a doe on an equatorial island who grows up to discover the truth about the world and his own place in it, unaided—but also unimpeded—by society, language, or tradition. Hayy’s discoveries about God, nature, and man challenge the values of the culture in which the tale was written as well as those of every contemporary society.Goodman’s commentary places Hayy Ibn Yaqzan in its historical and philosophical context. The volume features a new preface and index, and an updated bibliography.“One of the most remarkable books of the Middle Ages.”—Times Literary Supplement“An enchanting and puzzling story. . . . The book transcends all historical and cultural environments to settle upon the questions of human life that perpetually intrigue men.”—Middle East Journal“Goodman has done a service to the modern English reader by providing a readable translation of a philosophically significant allegory.”—Philosophy East and West“Add[s] bright new pieces to an Islamic mosaic whose general shape is already known.”—American Historical Review},

Conflicting results were overcome by extracting stable information from the tested range of diverse parameter results of Rolling Delta, and by establishing majority attributions of the text chunks with Rolling Classify. Both approaches were applied to the well-recognized 1911 edition of the play, prepared by W. Greg. This followed the given folio sequence 3a–22a and then made the various additions. Each of the additions was not long enough to establish convincing results as to its authorship, but the folio sequences of the original text could be analysed with larger and reliable window sizes, revealing Samuel Rowley and William Shakespeare as authors. The long-standing claim that Munday or Chettle is the author of the original text of the play proved to be unsustainable. As far as the conventional dating is concerned, an earlier analysis of Thomas of Woodstock, largely written by Rowley, and in part by Shakespeare, points, if later revisions are disregarded, to the period 1592–93.},

As collaborative scenarios count among the assets of these relatively new stylometric tools, it became possible to tip the scales towards Glatzer’s view that the plays have two authors, and Leishman’s advocacy of one author, based on the manuscript prologue of Part 2 of The Return, gave way to a ‘battle of the plays’ between Marston and Nashe.},

Two events in the late 960s/1550s changed the strategic balance between the Ottoman and Habsburg empires. First, in 964/1556, Charles V abdicated. His son Philip II inherited his territories in Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, but not the Holy Roman empire, leading to a split in the Spanish and Austrian branches of the dynasty. Second, in 968/1559 Philip II and Henry II of France concluded a peace at Cateau-Cambrésis, removing the possibility of a Franco- Ottoman alliance and undermining Ottoman influence in the politics of western Europe. The effect of Ottoman operations in the southern seas was to create a land frontier against the Portuguese.},

Upward sweeps are defined as instances in which the largest sovereign polity in a network of fighting and allying polities significantly increases in size. Collapses are instances in which the size of the largest polity greatly decreases and stays down for a significant period of time (centuries). We use regional interpolity systems rather than single polities as the unit of analysis, following the comparative world-systems framework. We are limited to those regions and time periods for which quantitative estimates of largest polity sizes are available. We compare the frequencies of cycles and sweeps across five interpolity networks, and find more similarities than differences across the five systems. This is somewhat surprising because most studies that compare East Asia with the West stress important differences. We find a total of 22 upsweeps and 19 downsweeps across the five systems, but only three instances of prolonged system-wide collapse. We also find that the frequency of cycles increased over the long run, while the frequencies of upsweeps and downsweeps did not display long-term trends. The lack of a downward trend in downsweeps challenges the supposition that resilience grows with sociocultural complexity and size.},

The north-western districts of the Punjab, as we shall see, lay within the penumbra of Mongol sovereignty.

A change of tempo is visible during Ala al-Din Khalji's reign in the context of relations with independent Hindu kingdoms. Both the successful resistance to major Mongol attacks during Ala al-Din's era and the pronounced territorial expansion over which he presided were made possible by administrative measures which greatly extended the area under the sultan's direct control and subjected it to a uniform system of land-tax.},

Participants included 15 highly trained pianists and 21 individuals with little or no formal music training. The groups were comparable in terms of age, gender distribution, and socioeconomic status. Musicians showed superior immediate and delayed recall of word lists and greater use of a semantic clustering strategy during initial list-learning than nonmusicians. They also exhibited superior learning, delayed recall, and delayed recognition for visual designs. Group differences in delayed free recall of both words and designs persisted after controlling statistically for estimated Full Scale IQ. These results suggest that extensive music training is associated with a generalized enhancement of auditory and visual memory functions.},

  abstract = {In the Near East the first five centuries after the Hijra (622-1106 A.D.) were dominated by the spread of Islam and the growth of Muslim states, and both developments were dependent on writing materials. This dissertation traces the history of writing materials and related crafts, craftsmen, and procedures during that period. From rough beginnings in the time of Muhammad (PBUH) through an efflorescence in the first century of ('c)Abbasid rule, the stationer's trade touched on a wide variety of technological developments and was involved in a similarly wide range of intellectual and administrative changes. The craft of wiraqah, 'stationery' in the broadest sense, was an institution which came to exercise significant political, social, and economic influence. Its initial growth, however, was due to the central role of the Qur'an in Islam, and it continued to be closely tied to spiritual and intellectual life in the prosperous ('c)Abbasid capital of Baghdad. The dissertation treats both the religious-intellectual and administrative aspects of the growing use of paper; it also touches on the writing materials used among the Arabs before the advent of paper, and the complex route by which that invention came from China via Samarqand into the world of Islam. Paper-manufacturing centers are surveyed, and the trade in stationery, the traders, and their trading places are treated, along with auxiliary crafts, notably copying and bookbinding. The processes of writing books and selling them are also explored, with attention to the public character of much composition in the medieval period. The dissertation draws largely on Arabic annalistic and belletristic sources, notably Ibn al-Nad(')im and Yaqut, modern papyrological, bibliographical, and codicological studies, though they are few in number, are also drawn on to supplement the literary sources.},

Being a relatively simple task for modern languages, the collation of medieval text traditions ranges from the complex to the virtually impossible depending on the degree of instability of textual transmission. We present a visual analytics environment that supports computationally aligning such complex textual differences typical of orally inflected medieval poetry. For the purpose of analyzing alignment, we provide interactive visualizations for different text hierarchy levels, specifically, a meso reading view to support investigating repetition and variance at the line level across text segments. In addition to outlining important aspects of our interdisciplinary collaboration, we emphasize the utility of the proposed system by various usage scenarios in medieval French literature.},

  abstract = {This article describes the development and application of an innovative tool, Text Re-use Alignment Visualization (TRAViz), whose aim is to visualize variation between editions of both historical and modern texts. Reading different editions of a text empowers research in literary studies and linguistics, where one can study a text’s reception or follow the development of its language over time. One of the purposes of a text edition is to trace or reconstruct a possible archetype or something that might be considered to be an original version of the text in order to better understand its evolution over time. To do so, the textual scholar examines and records the similarities and the differences between a number of exemplars in what is known as a ‘critical apparatus’. The result of this variant analysis can be visually represented as a ‘Variant Graph’, where the relationships between these exemplars can be more easily studied. Variant Graphs can be, in turn, visualized in order to facilitate reading and interaction with the source data. Borrowing from existing digital tools, TRAViz assists the scholar in the collation process by specifically focusing on design and user engagement, concurrently seeking to simplify interaction as a means of encouraging humanists to adopt the tool. The article will describe the needs and rationale behind the creation of TRAViz by exploring existing research, describing its functionality through examples, and by finally discussing how its application can influence future development of this tool in particular and of the field in general.},

It suggests more attention to the material and cultural determinations of slaves' lives, to the condition of enslaved humanity and to the everyday processes of political action among the enslaved as alternative approaches. Finally, it argues that the injunction to "give the slaves back their agency" was a scholarly call to arms which was meaningful at the moment in which the New Social History emerged, but which has now lost its political salience and suggests that if historians are to continue to frame their scholarship as an act of historical redress, they should do so in terms more suited to the current circumstances.},

  abstract = {Two famous, firsthand accounts of the holy war in the Middle Ages translated by Caroline Smith Originally composed in Old French, the two chronicles brought together here offer some of the most vivid and reliable accounts of the Crusades from a Western perspective. Villehardouin's Conquest of Constantinople, distinguished by its simplicity and lucidity, recounts the controversial Fourth Crusade, which descended into an all-out attack on the E astern Christians of Byzantium. In Life of Saint Louis, Joinville draws on his close attachment to King Louis IX of France to recall his campaigning in the Holy Land. Together these narratives comprise a fascinating window on events that, for all their remoteness, offer startling similarities to our own age.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The volume also contains analyses of individual biographies and discussions of Ibn 'Asākir's treatment of larger classes of people, including the first analysis of his biographies of women.

Focusing on “enumerative games” (Mainberger), the article does not ask what the enumerated elements mean, but how the act of enumerating produces meaning. In the first part, the article discusses elements central to the poetics of the enumerative (including items, length, arrangement, and frame). In the second part it deals with the politics of enumeration in the example of al-Shidyāq’s {$<$}em{$>$}al-Sāq ʿalā al-sāq fī mā huwa al-Fāriyāq{$<$}/em{$>$} (1855).

  abstract = {‘Authorship attribution’, the problem of determining the author (or the author's attributes, such as gender, age, native language, or other characteristics) by examining the writing style of an unknown work, is an important problem in applied linguistics. The theory of authorship attribution is relatively straightforward: language is an underspecified system, and people can pick and choose among several different ways to describe the same thing. These choices, in turn, become habituated and can be identified as persistent patterns of an individual or group of writers.One important psycholinguistic underpinning to this solution is the universal existence (in natural languages) of so-called “marker words” or ‘function words,’–little, closed-class words that do not carry much semantics but instead denote relationships between content words. Because these words are so lightly processed, writers/speakers can choose among many different near-synonymous forms, and implicitly express their identity in doing so.Do constructed languages have this same degree of near-synonymity? We present the results of a study of authorship attribution using an ad-hoc corpus of fan-written documents in various constructed languages, and show that even artificial languages constructed for artistic purposes, such as Klingon, Na'vi, and Elvish, permit this type of analysis. This indicates that even constructed languages tend to be psycholinguistically plausible.},

This protocol (or close variants of it) has been used in at least four separate cases across a wide variety of documents and consumers. It is mathematically supported while still being easy to understand.

The individual subjects we tackle are (in order): logic and proof, discrete mathematics, abstract algebra, probability and statistics, calculus, and differential equations. This is not at all the order in which these subjects are usually taught in school curricula, and indeed, it is possible to take a course of study that does not include all of them.

These changes are explained by recent challenges for social history writing such as the shifts of European societies away from the classical topics of social history, the trend of internationalization, the cultural turn and the upheaval of 1989/90. The end of the article presents what might be future topics of social history: the return to the history of burning social questions, the social history of politics, the cultural enlargement of social history and the social history of Europe as a whole.},

Although it focuses primarily on the period from 1270 during which \&apos;Ethiopian\&apos; was a national rather than ethnic identity, it shares several themes with other papers in this volume. After considering the manner in which Christianity reached Ethiopia and in particular the central role played by the royal court in the acceptance and consolidation of the Church, attention is given to the claims of successive Ethiopian rulers and ethnic groups to be \&apos;Israelites\&apos;, that is, descendants of biblical figures most notably King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. The paper next considers the manner in which monastic movements, which emerged in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, were associated with ethnically based resistance to the expansion of the Christian kingdom. Other themes include the development of a tradition of biblical interpretation and Christological controversies. The paper concludes with a discussion of ongoing research concerning the Ethiopian diaspora which has developed in the period since the Marxist revolution of 1974.},

The essay provides an overview of the state of Qur’anic studies in Iran today, aiming to examine the extent of the impact of studies by Western scholars on Iranian academic circles during the last three decades and the relationship between them. As in most Islamic countries, the major bulk of academic activity in Iran in this field used to be undertaken by the traditional ‘ulamā’; however, since the beginning of the twentieth century and the establishment of universities and other academic institutions in the Islamic world, there has been increasing diversity and development. After the Islamic Revolution, many gradual changes in the structure and approach of centres of religious learning and universities have occurred. Contemporary advancements in modern sciences and communications technologies have gradually brought the institutions engaged in the study of human sciences to confront the new context. As a result, the traditional Shī‘ī centres of learning, which until 50 years ago devoted themselves exclusively to the study of Islamic law and jurisprudence, today pay attention to the teaching of foreign languages, Qur’anic sciences and exegesis, including Western studies about the Qur’an, to a certain extent, and recognise the importance of almost all of the human sciences of the West. تغيرت مكانة التفسير والدراسات القرآنية في جمهورية ﺇيران الإسلامية تغيرﺍﹰ كبيرﺍﹰ في العقود الأخيرة . ﺗﻘﺪﹼم هذه المقالة نبذة عن الوضع الحالي للدراسات القرآنية في ﺇيران، وﺗﻘﻴﹼﻢ مدى ﺗﺄﺛﻴﺮ الدراسات التي ينتجها باحثون غربيون على الأكاديميين الإيرانيين خلال العقود الثلاثة الأخيرة، والعلاقات بين الطرفين . ففي ﺇيران، كما الحال في معظم الدول الإسلامية الأخرى، كان معظم ﺍﻟﻌﻤﻞ الأكاديمي في هذا المجال حكرﺍﹰ على العلماء التقليديين . لكن منذ بداية القرن العشرين ومع إنشاء جامعات ومعاهد أكاديمية أخرى في العالم الإسلامي، ﺇزداد التنوع والتطور في هذا المجال . وبعد الثورة الإسلامية أخذ المنهج الأكاديمي المتبع في مراكز التعليم الديني والجامعات في التحول التدريجي . إذ رغمت التطورات المعاصرة في العلوم الحديثة وفي تقنيات الإتصال المعاهدﹶ المهتمة بالعلوم الإنسانية على أخذ السياق المعامر بعين الإعتبار . ولذا أخذت مراكز التعليم الشيعية التقليدية، التي ظلت إلى ما قبل خمسين سنة لا ﺗﺪﺭﹼﺱ إلا الفقه، ﺗﻌﺘﻨﻲ اليوم بتدريس اللغات الأجنبية والعلوم القرآنية والتفسير، بما فيها الدراسات الغربية عن القرآن، وصار تعترف بقيمة معظم العلوم الإنسانية في الغرب .},

He described Nöldeke as a great scholar and his Geschichte des Qorâns as a valuable contribution. Al-Zanjānī's work also included an outline of Nöldeke's discussion on the order of the revelation of the suras. It is probably safe to say that al-Zanjānī's book is the first independent work on the history of the Qur'an by a Muslim scholar. This fact leads one to wonder about the apparent lack of previous interest in the historiography of the Qur'an among Islamic scholarship. The present paper seeks to address this question and offer an overview of historiographical scholarship on the Qur'an contributed by Muslim writers both before and following Nöldeke بعد خمسة وسبعين سنة تقريبا من ظهور كتاب نولدكه بعنوان (تاريخ القرآن) أشار العالم الايراني أبو عبد اللّه الزنجاني (1892—1941) إشارة سريعة في الفصل الأخير من كتابه إلى نسخة من كتاب نولدكه بتنقيح شوالي وبرجستراسر وبريتزل. وقال الزنجاني إن نولدكه باحث عظيم وإن كتابه إسهام قيّم. واشتمل كتاب الزنجاني على ملخص لما ذكره نولدكه عن ترتيب وحي السور في القرآن. ولعله من غير المجازفة أن نقول إن كتاب الزنجاني أول عمل مستقل لباحث مسلم عن تاريخ القرآن، وهذا يدفعنا إلى التساؤل عن القصور الواضح من قبل في الاهتمام بتاريخ القرآن اهتماما كافيا في الكتابات الاسلامية. ويهدف هذا المقال إلى النظر في هذه المسألة كما يقدم عرضا عاما لكتابات الباحثين المسلمين في تاريخ القرآن قبل نولدكه وبعده.},

First, the speech acts of the Prophet are analyzed using the categories put forward by John Searle to see how they function within the conversation.

Part I provides a quick introduction to R and presents the key features of FactoMineR and factoextra. Part II describes classical principal component methods to analyze data sets containing, predominantly, either continuous or categorical variables. These methods include: Principal Component Analysis (PCA, for continuous variables), simple correspondence analysis (CA, for large contingency tables formed by two categorical variables) and Multiple CA (MCA, for a data set with more than 2 categorical variables). In part III, you'll learn advanced methods for analyzing a data set containing a mix of variables (continuous and categorical) structured or not into groups: Factor Analysis of Mixed Data (FAMD) and Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA). Part IV covers hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC), which is useful for performing clustering with a data set containing only categorical variables or with a mixed data of categorical and continuous variables.},

  abstract = {Highlights, scribbling, and marginal notes: Annotation is often a private practice that we only occasionally share with others, or even more rarely share publicly. Once considered fundamental to hypertext systems, the potential of annotating digital documents is often overlooked in today's technology. As data commonly leaves our devices when collaborating, further questions arise on digital ownership and privacy. In this thesis, I examine the question of how both ownership and privacy can be ensured in the context of Digital Humanities research, which increasingly leverages interoperable infrastructures and Linked Open Data. In an explorative study, I first investigate the aspects of real-time collaboration in research tools, followed by an examination of institutional services on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. By establishing interoperability between such networks and the web, I then propose two approaches for bridging those networks and strengthening privacy, ownership, and private collaboration following the paradigm of local-first software. I argue that by balancing the autonomy of peers and the determinism of the web, gateways can translate across the separation of both networks while supporting peers by providing archiving and data availability. This enables researchers to perform private and collaborative annotation, while the underlying data can be embedded into existing workflows due to the bridge between both systems. Future work concerns the viability of this approach in scholarly environments and further research on the usability of distributed systems in the academic context.},

  abstract = {Earthquakes are among the most horrible events of nature due to unexpected occurrence, for which no spiritual means are available for protection. The only way of preserving life and property is to prepare for the inevitable: applying earthquake-resistant construction methods. Zones of damaging earthquakes along the Silk Road are reviewed for seismic hazard and to understand the ways local civilizations coped with it during the past two thousand years. China and its wide sphere of cultural influence certainly had earthquake-resistant architectural practice, as the high number of ancient buildings, especially high pagodas, prove. A brief review of anti-seismic design and construction methods (applied both for wooden and masonry buildings) is given, in the context of earthquake-prone zones of Northern China. Muslim architects in Western China and Central Asia used brick and mortar to construct earthquake-resistant structural systems. Ancient Greek architects in Anatolia and the Aegean applied steel clamps embedded in lead casing to hold together columns and masonry walls during frequent earthquakes. Romans invented concrete and built all sizes of buildings as a single, non-flexible unit. Masonry, surrounding and decorating the concrete core of the wall, did not bear load. Concrete resisted minor shaking, yielding only to forces higher than fracture limits. Roman building traditions survived the Dark Ages, and 12th century Crusader castles erected in earthquake-prone Syria survive until today in reasonably good condition. Usage of earthquake-resistant technology depends on the perception of earthquake risks and on available financial resources. Earthquake-resistant construction practice is significantly more expensive than regular construction. Frequent earthquakes maintain safe construction practices, like the timber-laced masonry tradition in the Eastern Mediterranean throughout 500 years of political and technological development.},

SKAD, which has been in the process of development since the middle of the 1990s, is now a widely used framework among social scientists in discourse research in the German-speaking area. It links arguments from the social constructionist tradition, following Berger and Luckmann, with assumptions based in symbolic interactionism, hermeneutic sociology of knowledge, and the concepts of Michel Foucault. It argues thereby for a consistent theoretical and methodological grounding of a genuine social sciences perspective on discourse interested in the social production, circulation and transformation of knowledge, that is in social relations and politics of knowledge in the so-called 'knowledge societies'. Distancing itself from Critical Discourse Analysis, Linguistics, Ethnomethodology inspired discourse analysis and the Analysis of Hegemonies, following Laclau and Mouffe, SKAD's framework has been built up around research questions and concerns located in the social sciences, referring to public discourse and arenas as well as to more specific fields of (scientific, religious, etc.) discursive struggles and controversies around "problematizations" (Foucault).},

Teaching History in the Digital Age serves as a guide for practitioners on how to fruitfully employ the transformative changes of digital media in the research, writing, and teaching of history. T.

The Ghaznavids rulers followed the middle Abbasid practice of recruiting an army of Turkish ghilman and collecting taxes to pay them.

The building works of this ruler and his amirs transformed the fabric of the Mamluk capital, Cairo, and shaped its future development in decades to come. For most of al-Nasir Muhammads sultanate, Tankiz al-Nasiri ruled as governor of the Syrian province. Tankizs term was one of the longest for any amir to retain a single office and to remain in the good graces of this sultan, known for his mercurial nature. Tankiz played a critical role in Mamluk politics and Syrian history. His lengthy tenure also allowed him to give sustained attention to the built environment of the province. During his term, he undertook an ambitious program of construction that involved monuments, urban works and renewal projects. This book investigates Tankizs building program by identifying the works that he commissioned, exploring the nature of his participation in these works, and situating them within the broader contexts of architectural development in the region and patronage during the Mamluk period. The volume features over 80 photographs and other illustrations, including several in full color. It is fully indexed and provides a wealth of references to primary and secondary literature.},

From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre attributed to Hildegard is fascinating. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries in Latin, a language of which she did not master all grammatical subtleties. She therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. Especially Hildegard’s last collaborator, Guibert of Gembloux, seems to have considerably reworked her works during his secretaryship. Whereas her other scribes were only allowed to make superficial linguistic changes, Hildegard would have permitted Guibert to render her language stylistically more elegant. In this article, we focus on two shorter texts: the Visio ad Guibertum missa and Visio de Sancto Martino, both of which Hildegard allegedly authored during Guibert’s secretaryship. We analyze a corpus containing the letter collections of Hildegard, Guibert, and Bernard of Clairvaux using a number of common stylometric techniques. We discuss our results in the light of the Synergy Hypothesis, suggesting that texts resulting from collaboration can display a style markedly different from that of the collaborating authors. Finally, we demonstrate that Guibert must have reworked the disputed visionary texts allegedly authored by Hildegard to such an extent that style-oriented computational procedures attribute the texts to Guibert.},

While this task has long been considered solved for modern languages such as English, there exist many (e.g. historic) languages for which the problem is harder to solve, due to a lack of resources and unstable orthography. Our approach is based on recent advances in the field of ‘deep’ representation learning, where neural networks have led to a dramatic increase in performance across several domains. The proposed system combines two approaches: on the one hand, we apply temporal convolutions to model the orthography of input words at the character level; secondly, we use distributional word embeddings to represent the lexical context surrounding the input words. We demonstrate how this system reaches state-of-the-art performance on a number of representative Middle Dutch data sets, even without corpus-specific parameter tuning.},

Although there was an earlier and substantial historiographical tradition, Ibn ʿAsākir's biography is distinct from those of his predecessors in two major ways. First, he strategically arranged his biography to emphasize or de-emphasize certain aspects of ʿUmar II's life, including his youth, rise to the caliphate, and reputation as a redeemer. Second, Ibn ʿAsākir's legitimizing historiography appears to be bi-directional. Namely, where earlier biographers depicted ʿUmar II as the “fifth of the Rāshidūn,” bolstering the later Umayyad's reputation through an association with earlier authorities, in Ibn ʿAsākir's account problematic aspects of the early civil wars and fitna-ridden Rāshidūn period are also elided through the Rāshidūn's association with the famously pious ʿUmar II. The context for this bi-directionality is to be found in the political and social environment in which Ibn ʿAsākir compiled his Tārīkh, where dual pressure from Crusader and Shiʿite opponents contributed to his articulation of a particular Sunni vision of political and religious continuity that relied heavily on ‘Umar II's unique persona.},

While never universally accepted by all later Sunnī scholars as necessarily connoting unassailable personal integrity, the notion of ʿadāla was nevertheless emphasized in an enormous range of Sunnī theological and ḥadīth works and especially in Companionate biographical compilations throughout the Middle Ages. From the mid-fifth century AH onward, Sunnī biographers reinterpreted the collective probity and uprightness of the Companions in biographical compilations; works which expanded in both scope and content to become an integral aspect of competing articulations of community and authority in the sectarian atmosphere of the later Middle Ages.},

  abstract = {Rather than a handbook or chronological history of secretaries and viziers, or a straightforward guide to administrative terminology, the Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb by Muḥammad b. al-ʿAbdūs al-Ǧahšiyārī (d. 331/942) is a collection of ʿAbbāsid-era narratives on the history of early Islamic administration. Related to other works in the genre adab al-kātib, the Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb provides insight into one compiler's literary techniques as well as his social/cultural agenda. The portion of al-Ǧahšiyārī's work analyzed here focuses on key events in the Umayyad period and illustrates his apologetic stance on the non-Muslim foundations of ʿAbbāsid administrative structures especially well. Using short anecdotes that contain pithy, repetitive tropes of non-Muslim administrative officials' arrogance or incompetence, al-Ǧahšiyārī polemically mythologized a foundations narrative for early Islamic administrative history. Several studies of another portion of this text, on the ʿAbbāsid caliphs and the Barmakids, have determined the literary/historical value of al-Ǧahšiyārī's work. In these brief comments, four short anecdotes from a relatively understudied portion of the Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb are assessed in order to demonstrate al-Ǧahšiyārī's mode of representation for the earliest stages of Islamic administration. Plutôt qu'un manuel ou une histoire chronologique des bureaucrates et des vizirs ou un simple guide d'initiation à la terminologie administrative, le Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb de Muhammad b. al-ʿAbdūs al-Ǧahšiyārī (d. 331/942) est une collection de récits de l'époque abbasside sur la genèse de l'administration islamique. Lié à d'autres œuvres du genre adab al-kātib, le Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb met en lumière certaines techniques littéraires du compilateur ainsi que ses préoccupations socio-culturelles. L'extrait de l'œuvre d'al-Ǧahšiyārī que nous analysons dans cet article met l'accent sur les événements marquants de la période omeyyade et illustre particulièrement bien sa position apologétique sur les fondations non musulmanes des structures administratives abbasides. En utilisant de courtes anecdotes qui contiennent des tropes répétitives et concises de l'arrogance ou de l'incompétence des responsables administratifs non-musulmans, al-Ǧahšiyārī mythologise de façon polémique un récit des fondations du début de l'histoire administrative islamique. Plusieurs études d'un autre extrait de ce même texte, centrées sur les califes abbassides et les Barmécides, ont déterminé la valeur littéraire et historique de l'œuvre d'al-Ǧahšiyārī. Dans les brefs commentaires qui suivent, quatre courtes anecdotes d'une portion relativement peu étudiée du Kitāb al-Wuzarāʾ wa-l-kuttāb sont évaluées afin de démontrer le mode de représentation des premières étapes de l'administration islamique par al-Ǧahšiyārī.},

Such economists, belonging to the original (old) institutional economics and the historical school maintain that the constraint function is riddled with inefficient technologies and institutions which agents fail to replace with superior ones even when the switching cost is clearly lower than expected benefit. The argument ultimately rests on a theory of action á la Herbert Simon—where agents become habituated for whatever is the default institution. Such a theory recognizes that agents are ready to replace habits with more viable ones—but only when agents face shocks or crises. Such recognition, though, necessarily allows rational choice, in the sense of responsiveness to incentives, to enter from the rear window: after all, shocks and crises are merely severe incentives.},

It has been stated that Miskawaih belonged to the second group of historians and his concept of history, which he outlined in his voluminous historical work Tajārib al-Umam, was astonishingly modern. The conclusion drawn is that Miskawaih occupies a unique place among the Arabic historians. He belongs to the group of courtiers and secretaries. Even in his own group he possesses a marked individuality and his history has many distinctive features. Although a Persian, he was a remarkable representative of the Arabic culture of his age. He had something to offer to Arabic historiography in the way of political thinking about history and interest in statecraft and civil administration. Miskawaih was the first Arabic historian with a definite concept of history and he applied this to the writing of the history of his own time. This was his personal contribution to Arabic historiography.},

We examine the existing theoretical and conceptual models on the relations between space and emotions and illustrate how scholars need to bring together narratives, materiality, and practices in order to understand the entanglement of space and emotions. Through four different but connected historical examples: Mughal imperial Delhi, princely Rampur, small towns milieux in colonial India and the Lyari neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, we trace the shifting configurations of power, emotions, and social space of “Muslim locales” in South Asia. On this particular terrain, we also want to specify the nature of change in emotional experiences as Muslim locales transformed from elite enclaves into locales of disempowerment in the transition to national independence. We examine the shifting discourses and practices in the built environment, in the landscapes portrayed in visual and literary reconstructions, and in the lived everyday spatial practices and experiences in South Asia. While providing a historical narrative, these articles also present new possibilities to explore affective archives and interdisciplinary approaches for writing a history of emotions.},

Such concerns are often driven by material and cultural struggles for power. Thus, discourses around education for girls and women are sites for the construction not only of gender identity but also of class, religion, and the nation"--Provided by publisher},

However, text analysis of these documents has rarely been done mainly due to the lack of natural language processing tools that can handle pre-modern Japanese. In this article, we propose a method to extract and visualize the relationships among persons from Japanese historical documents with an aid of supplementary information such as personal name and place name indices. The goal of the method is to extract dynamics of relationships among historical persons. The method utilizes locational information to obtain latent relationships among persons based on their spatial activities. The proposed method is applied to a Japanese historical chronicle written in the 12th century. Experimental results showed a strong correspondence to the known historical facts, and the results of a user survey completed by researchers of Japanese history demonstrated some potential for the method to serve as a new approach in the fields of humanities.},

It focuses on fear and insecurity as emotional practices that structure the spatial and social relations in the city. Using the narratives of young Baloch men who must negotiate the threat of violence at the hands of criminal gangs and state security forces within their area and rival political parties outside the area, the article highlights how fear and insecurity must be understood as being contextually situated, depending on one’s social and geographical position within the city. The experiences of these young men demonstrate how emotions such as fear and insecurity are both produced by and reproduce spatial configurations of power.},

  abstract = {Extreme Inscription” attempts to articulate the grammatological primitives of the hard drive, the inscription technology that has had the single greatest impact on computing in the latter half of the 20th century. Rather than offer up yet another generalized account of electronic textuality, my objective in this essay is to examine one specific writing machine in its unique social, technical, and imaginative milieu. Random access disk storage, I argue, is the technology that embodies the “database paradigm” a critic such as Lev Manovich sees as fundamental to new media. The history of hard drive technology is treated in the essay, as is the cultural impact of new hard drive-based technologies like iPod, TiVo, and Gmail’s massive multi-gigabyte quotas. Ultimately the article seeks to establish a place for the often invisible and certainly unglamorous presence of storage technologies amid the largely visual and screen-based approaches that currently prevail in new media theory.},

During the period of the pivotal growth and widespread adoption of word processing as a writing technology, some authors embraced it as a marvel while others decried it as the death of literature. The product of years of archival research and numerous interviews conducted by the author, Track Changes is the first literary history of word processing. Matthew Kirschenbaum examines how the interests and ideals of creative authorship came to coexist with the computer revolution. Who were the first adopters? What kind of anxieties did they share? Was word processing perceived as just a better typewriter or something more? How did it change our understanding of writing? Track Changes balances the stories of individual writers with a consideration of how the seemingly ineffable act of writing is always grounded in particular instruments and media, from quills to keyboards. Along the way, we discover the candidates for the first novel written on a word processor, explore the surprisingly varied reasons why writers of both popular and serious literature adopted the technology, trace the spread of new metaphors and ideas from word processing in fiction and poetry, and consider the fate of literary scholarship and memory in an era when the final remnants of authorship may consist of folders on a hard drive or documents in the cloud."--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {The usual focus in authorship studies is on authorship attribution, i.e. determining which author (of a given set) wrote a piece of unknown provenance. The usual setting involves a small number of candidate authors, which means that the focus quickly revolves around a search for features that discriminate among the candidates. Whether the features that serve to discriminate among the authors are characteristic is then not of primary importance. We respectfully suggest an alternative in this article, namely a focus on seeking features that are characteristic for an author with respect to others. To determine an author’s characteristic features, we first seek elements that he or she uses consistently, which we therefore regard as ‘representative’, but we likewise seek elements which the author uses ‘distinctively’ in comparison to an opposing author. We test the idea on a task recently proposed that compares Charles Dickens to both Wilkie Collins and a larger reference set comprising several authors’ works from the 18th and 19th century. We then compare the use of representative and distinctive features to Burrows’ ‘Delta’ and Hoovers’ ‘CoV Tuning’; we find that our method bears little similarity with either method in terms of characteristic feature selection. We show that our method achieves reliable and consistent results in the two-author comparison and fair results in the multi-author one, measured by separation ability in clustering.},

We propose that topic modeling, when conceived as a process of thematic exploration, can provide a new entry point into this process. To this end, we present research on a new software tool called TOME: Interactive TOpic Model and MEtadata Visualization, designed to support the exploratory thematic analysis of digitized archival collections. TOME is centered around a set of visualizations intended to facilitate the interpretation of the topic model and its incorporation into extant humanities research practices. In contrast to other topic model browsers, which present the model on its own terms, ours is informed by the process of conducting early-stage humanities research. Our article thus also demonstrates the conceptual conversions—in terms of both design and process—that interdisciplinary collaboration necessarily entails. In making these conversions explicit, and exploring the implications of their successes and failures, we take up the call, as voiced by Johanna Drucker (Humanities approaches to graphical display. Digital Humanities Quarterly, 5(1), 2011), to resist the ‘intellectual Trojan horse’ of visualization. We seek to model a new mode of interdisciplinary inquiry, one that brings the methodological emphasis of the digital humanities to bear on the practices of humanities research and computer science alike.},

Fields represented include computer science, information systems, management, journalism, psychology, law, library science, and sociology. This volume introduces some of the major controversies surrounding the computerization of society and helps readers recognize the social processes that drive and shape computerization. Division into eight provocatively titled sections facilitates course planning for classroom or seminar use. A lead article for each section frames the major controversies, locates the selections within the debates, and points to other relevant literature. Key Features • A fully revised and updated version of the first anthological treatment of the subject • Organized to facilitate course planning for classroom or seminar use • Provides coverage of the influence of computers on a wide variety of fields including computer science, information systems, management, journalism, psychology, law, library science, and sociology • Includes discussion of the following issues related to computerization: • Does computerization demonstrably improve the productivity of organizations? • Should computer systems be designed to empower workers? • Does electronic mail facilitate the formation of new communities, or does it undermine intimate interaction? • Is computerization likely to reduce privacy and personal freedom?},

To evaluate effects of presentation mode, pupil dilation was measured in three tasks spanning a range of cognitive activities: mental multiplication, digit sequence recall, and vigilance. Stimuli were presented both aurally and visually, controlling for all known visual influences on pupil diameter. The patterns of dilation were similar for both aural and visual presentation for all three tasks, but the magnitudes of pupil response were greater for aural presentation. Accuracy was higher for visual presentation for mental arithmetic and digit recall. The findings can be accounted for in terms of dual codes in working memory and suggest that cognitive load is lower for visual than for aural presentation.},

In this perspective, a vector-space representation can be generated for each author or disputed text according to words and their nearby context. To determine the authorship of a disputed text, the cosine similarity between vector representations can be applied. The proposed strategies can be adapted without any difficulty to different languages (such as English and Italian) or genres (essays, political speeches, and newspaper articles). Evaluations using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NNs))and based on four test collections (the Federalist Papers, the State of the Union addresses, the Glasgow Herald, and La Stampa newspapers) indicate that the distributed language representation preforms well, providing sometimes better effectiveness than state-of-the-art methods such as k-NN, nearest shrunken centroids, chi-square, Delta, latent Dirichlet allocation, or multi-layer perceptron classifier.},

  abstract = {The name (Meletē)ToPān v.0.3 is based on the Greek principle μελέτη τὸ πᾶν which roughly translate to "take into care everything". I decided for the name because Topic-Modelling performs well on large amounts of logically structured chunks of texts and it helps selecting the interesting bits in a large corpus of text by technically having looked at everything. The butterfly in the logo is of the species Melete. The original photograph is by Didier Descouens and he has licensed it under CC BY-SA 4.0. I changed the image for the logo slightly. I'd strongly suggest to start with the original if you want to use it, but you can also use this now slightly modified logo under CC BY-SA 4.0 license as I am required to share it under the same license as the original image. ToPān is Topic-Modelling for everyone: from people without programming knowledge to people that want to build teaching and text-reuse tools and apps based on Topic-Modelling data without having to develop their own tool or having to majorly restructure their textual data. ToPān is made to be shared and used. That is why I tried to modularise ToPān in a way that in each step you could ingest your own data. It works best however, if you work your way from left to right: from "Data Input" to "LDA Tables" (please find more details under "Instructions"). ToPān works best with files that are structured according to the CTS/CITE architecture. ToPān is also still under active development. This is an alpha release. More features will be added and you are encouraged to roadtest ToPān and send me feedback or report bugs. Technical Note: ToPān is written in RShiny and uses the following R-libraries: shiny, RCurl (also I mainly switch to httr, because of RCurl's mysterious errors and performance issues when sending lots and lots of requests), XML (but also install XML2), httr (and curl), lda, LDAvis. If you want to install a local version of ToPān, simply clone the repo, install R, RStudio, and the mentioned libraries and Bob's your uncle.},

Our goal is to make a comparison between the two genres concerning the importance of physical appearance of characters. In this article, as a first step in researching this topic, we consider the task of identifying sentences that contain descriptions of a character’s physical appearance in a set of novels in both genres. We manually annotate sentences where the appearance of a character is described. We then apply a machine learning methodology and manually written lexical–syntactic queries to automate the extraction of these sentences. Contrary to our expectations, the queries outperform the classifier. When we use a combination of the two automated methods, the extraction of physical descriptions from chick lit is more successful. This suggests that such descriptions are more uniform in character.},

We show that for this purpose, second-order document similarity measures taken from the authorship verification literature strongly outperform standard document similarity measures commonly used for outlier identification. We apply these improved methods to two famous corpora suspected of including pseudepigrapha: Shakespeare’s plays and Pauline epistles.},

This article presents a method of quantifying spelling variation as a linguistic variable whose relation with relevant grammatical and contextual variables can be statistically measured. Based on the normalization of the non-standard word forms and the subsequent calculation of edit distance between the normalized and attested word forms, the method is applicable to morphologically tagged historical text corpora and is here tested on an early medieval documentary Latin corpus with notable spelling variation. To justify the proposed method, several methodological issues of both philological and technical nature are discussed. The latter part of the article illustrates the potential of the method by way of a case study on the relationship between spelling variation and the use of non-standard prepositions in documentary Latin and by examining the chronological variation of spelling in its historical context. There appears to be a statistically significant dependence between non-standard spelling and the use of non-standard prepositions. It is also argued that the diachronic spelling distribution may be indicative of a spelling reform, in addition to reflecting an already known administrative change relative to scribal practices. Thus, the proposed method of quantifying spelling variation proves to offer interesting insights into the linguistic and historical reality underlying the text corpus.},

Situating the writing of English literary history within the context of the cultural market, print culture, and nationalism, I argue that the mid-century model of literary history both represents the dialectical outcome of previous decades of thinking through the problem of cultural change and puts in place the terms for the modern narrative of the literary canon. An earlier aesthetics of gendered and sociable refinement separated itself from a Gothic past later recovered as the singular moment of literary achievement. The Gothic account was then challenged by a rethinking of consumption as reading abstracted over time. Together, Gothic historicism and abstract reading formed the antithetical basis on which critics established the modern canonical account of English literary history.},

The basis of this investigation is represented by CorpusTracer, a database that stores the required data in a suitable format and with the required level of expressivity. In this article, we present the design of our database and our data model based on CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo. We discuss the implementation and suitability of the conceptual and technical realization for our research question. We conclude that FRBRoo fits well to the task at hand. We found that the comparatively complex data structure it requires can be sufficiently abstracted through current implementation methods. As the research continues, our data model will have to grow and we expect that the presented methods will be sufficient to accommodate our future requirements.},

The paper addresses a number of issues involved in the process of digitalising manuscripts included in the two existing editions (Ciasca 1888 and Marmardji 1935), adding variants in unedited manuscripts, encoding and lemmatising the text. Issues involved in the design of the ADP include presentation of variants, choice of the standard text, applicability of TEI guidelines, automatic translation between different encodings, cross-edition concordances and principles of lemmatisation.},

  abstract = {The start of the twenty-first century has brought with it a rich variety of ways in which readers can connect with one another, access texts, and make sense of what they are reading. At the same time, new technologies have also opened up exciting possibilities for scholars of reading and reception in offering them unprecedented amounts of data on reading practices, book buying patterns, and book collecting habits.In From Codex to Hypertext, scholars from multiple disciplines engage with both of these strands. This volume includes essays that consider how changes such as the mounting ubiquity of digital technology and the globalization of structures of publication and book distribution are shaping the way readers participate in the encoding and decoding of textual meaning. Contributors also examine how and why reading communities cohere in a range of contexts, including prisons, book clubs, networks of zinesters, state-funded programs designed to promote active citizenship, and online spaces devoted to sharing one's tastes in books.As concerns circulate in the media about the ways that reading -- for so long anchored in print culture and the codex -- is at risk of being irrevocably altered by technological shifts, this book insists on the importance of tracing the historical continuities that emerge between these reading practices and those of previous eras.In addition to the volume editor, contributors include Daniel Allington, Bethan Benwell, Jin Feng, Ed Finn, Danielle Fuller, David S. Miall, Julian Pinder, Janice Radway, Julie Rak, DeNel Rehberg Sedo, Megan Sweeney, Joan Bessman Taylor, Molly Abel Travis, and David Wright.},

The story focuses on the organization of families and tribes, religious groups and states, depicts them in their varied and changing contexts, and shows how they were transformed by their interactions with other religious and political communities into a varied, global and interconnected family of societies. The book concludes with the European commercial and imperial interventions that initiated a new set of transformations in the Islamic world, and the onset of the modern era. Organized in narrative sections for the history of each major region, with innovative, analytic summary introductions and conclusions, this book is a unique endeavor. Its breadth, clarity, style, and thoughtful exposition will ensure its place in the classroom and beyond as a guide for the educated reader"--},

Unlike many authors of similar surveys, Lassner and Bonner not only emphasize historical trends, but show readers how difficult it is to fashion a coherent historical narrative out of the complex and often contradictory primary sources. Readers thus participate in the intricate process by which professional historians attempt to reconstruct the past. At the same time, since classical Islamic civilization is so important for Muslims in the present-day Near East, this book will help the reader understand the contemporary Islamic world."--Jacket.},

  abstract = {LaTeX ( LAH-tekh or  LAY-tekh) is a document preparation system. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG ("what you see is what you get") word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses markup tagging conventions to define the general structure of a document (such as article, book, and letter), to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MikTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution. Within the typesetting system, its name is stylised as LaTeX. LaTeX is widely used in academia for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including mathematics, statistics, computer science, engineering, chemistry, physics, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Sanskrit and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the TeX macro language. LaTeX can be used as a standalone document preparation system, or as an intermediate format. In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating DocBook and other XML-based formats to PDF. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies.Like TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but even from early in its development, it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese.LaTeX is intended to provide a high-level, descriptive markup language that accesses the power of TeX in an easier way for writers. In essence, TeX handles the layout side, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX macros and a program to process LaTeX documents, and because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies. LaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by Leslie Lamport at SRI International. The current version is LaTeX2e (stylised as LaTeX2ε). LaTeX is free software and is distributed under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).},

  abstract = {"Preface About this book Two common types of user interfaces in statistical computing are the command line interface (CLI) and the graphical user interface (GUI). The usual CLI consists of a textual console in which the user types a sequence of commands at a prompt, and the output of the commands is printed to the console as text. The R console is an example of a CLI. A GUI is the primary means of interacting with desktop environments, such as Windows and Mac OS X, and statistical software, such as JMP. GUIs are contained within windows, and resources, such as documents, are represented by graphical icons. User controls are packed into hierarchical drop-down menus, buttons, sliders, etc. The user manipulates the windows, icons, and menus with a pointer device, such as a mouse. The R language, like its predecessor S, is designed for interactive use through a command line interface (CLI), and the CLI remains the primary interface to R. However, the graphical user interface (GUI) has emerged as an effective alternative, depending on the specific task and the target audience. With respect to GUIs, we see R users falling into three main target audiences: those who are familiar with programming R, those who are still learning how to program, and those who have no interest in programming. On some platforms, such as Windows and Mac OS X, R has graphical front-ends that provide a CLI through a text console control. Similar examples include the multi-platform RStudioTM IDE, the Java-based JGR and the RKWard GUI for the Linux KDE desktop. Although these interfaces are GUIs, they are still very much in essence CLIs, in that the primary mode of interacting with R is the same. Thus, these GUIs appeal mostly to those who are comfortable with R programming"--},

The group presented with visual text and a diagram rather than audio text and a diagram was superior, reversing most previous data on the modality effect. It was hypothesized that the reason for the reversal was that the transitory auditory text component was too long to be processed easily in working memory compared to more permanent written information. Experiment 2 (N = 64) replicated the experiment with the variation of a reduced length of both auditory and visual text instructions. Results indicated a reinstatement of the modality effect with audio/visual instructions proving superior to visual only instructions. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Sometimes the bibles are regarded as offering a corrupted view of the truth about the prophets and sometimes a less complete picture of them, which would explain the differences that are easy to detect.

The Arab idol worshippers were polytheists, but they also believed in a High God called Allah whose house was in the Kaba and who had supremacy over their tribal deities. In Medina, which was in many ways different from Mecca, idols were associated with various levels of the tribal organization. The Byzantines and Sasanians conducted their Arabian affairs through their respective Arab buffer kingdoms, Ghassan and al-Hira. Caravan trade was often behind the cooperation between certain nomadic tribes and the Sasanians. In addition to trade, the entrepreneurial Qurashis invested in agriculture. Since conditions in Mecca itself were uninviting for agriculture, they looked for opportunities elsewhere.},

This article places this phenomenon within the larger framework of Bedouin self-representation and explores the nature and specific uses of the complex and polysemic notion of nasab in treatises and speech. The ambiguity resulting from a tension between the pragmatic context of local articulation and circumstantial (re-)definition and the ideological significance, purportedly unchangeable and defined character and moral value of nasab is reflected in historical and modern discourses as well as in pervasive references to tribal groups as being defined by nasab. The particular concomitance of practical and ideological aspects is the reason for the lasting impact of this notion, as its structure allows for the negotiation of both political issues and individual and collective identities. The publications considered here, mostly from Syria, Jordan, and Iraq, vary between an affirmative stance that often seeks to define prestigious lineages and an attempt to balance the obvious uncertainties of the data with an interest in establishing the identity of tribal groups and narratives referring to descent. As Bedouin lore puts it, the concept of belonging defined by origins in terms of agnatic descent (nasab) is challenged, and sometimes superseded, by the affinity established through locality and cohabitation.},

  abstract = {The question of translators’ stylistic visibility in translated texts has been a recurring theme in translation studies. Recently, the employment of state-of-the-art stylometric methods such as multivariate statistical analysis or machine learning techniques has enabled important progress to be made in exploring the problem. Nevertheless, studies are conflicting in their findings. Some find evidence of translators’ stylistic presence, while others fail to do so. The lack of agreement in the literature makes one suspect some contextual factors affecting the degree of translators’ visibility. The present study focuses on one such possible factor—language combinations involved in translation. It is hypothesized that the farther the two languages involved are structurally apart, the more likely it is for the translator’s style to gain visibility as the increased distance will allow the translator greater freedom to be creative with his or her choices. The present study applies bootstrap consensus tree analysis and consensus network analysis to 175 samples of contemporary literary translation in two language pairs—the intimate pair of French and English and the distant pair of Korean and English. The analysis supports the hypothesis by showing that the authors completely override their translators to claim authorship in the French group, while authorial presence is significantly diminished in the Korean group, resulting in greater visibility for some translators.},

  abstract = {It is widely believed that different parts of a classical Chinese poem vary in syntactic properties. The middle part is usually parallel, i.e. the two lines in a couplet have similar sentence structure and part of speech; in contrast, the beginning and final parts tend to be non-parallel. Imagistic language, dominated by noun phrases evoking images, is concentrated in the middle; propositional language, with more complex grammatical structures, is more often found at the end. We present the first quantitative analysis on these linguistic phenomena—syntactic parallelism, imagistic language, and propositional language—on a treebank of selected poems from the Complete Tang Poems. Written during the Tang Dynasty between the 7th and 9th centuries CE, these poems are often considered the pinnacle of classical Chinese poetry. Our analysis affirms the traditional observation that the final couplet is rarely parallel; the middle couplets are more frequently parallel, especially at the phrase rather than the word level. Further, the final couplet more often takes a non-declarative mood, uses function words, and adopts propositional language. In contrast, the beginning and middle couplets employ more content words and tend toward imagistic language.},

Byzantium had made diplomatic contact with Central Asian Turks as early as the sixth century CE and later the movement of Turkic peoples across the steppes north of the Black Sea brought them to the empire's borders in eastern Europe. Byzantine defences in Anatolia were clearly ineffective, partly a result of almost continuous civil strife in Byzantium between the bureaucratic and military parties since the death of the emperor Basil II in 1025 CE. In 1068 CE the general Romanus Diogenes became emperor and, in a series of military expeditions, attempted to put an end to the growing Turkish danger. The Ottomans crystallised in the far northwestern corner of Anatolia around Sögüd at the end of the seventh/thirteenth century. By the beginning of the eighth/fourteenth century, the Saljuq sultanate had vanished.},

It begins with an exploration of the boundaries, functions and possible deployment of interpersonal networks formulated in the terminology of common tribal affiliation during that period, building on the author’s prosopographical study of the Arabic tribe (qabīla) of Kinda during the first three generations of Islamic history. It then considers the perspective of tribally founded elites, demonstrating and addressing their mainly local areas of authority as compared to administrative structures founded on visions of centralized power. In its last part, this paper moves from a longue durée comparison of the trajectories of families of different Kinda-affiliated tribal notables towards an assessment of the sources of authority at the disposal of a tribally-based leader, especially one in conflict with the central powers. On these three levels, this paper aims to determine the amount of independence available to tribal elites negotiating multiple roles. These roles included those of loyal provincial administrators, equal peers of global rulers and rebels contesting the legitimacy of the early Islamic Empire’s ruling elites on a potentially apocalyptic scale.},

In the wake of the Mongol invasion of Syria, an influx of civilian and military refugees poured into Egypt. Fugitives from the defeated Ayyūbid armies, and Turcomans and Kurds who had arrived in Syria earlier in flight from the Mongols, all joined the Mamlūk army. Barqūq's seizure of power in 784/1382 symbolises the restoration of the nondynastic Mamlūk sultanate, and the move from a Turkish to a Circassian sultanate. Mamlūks of Circassian origin formed the majority in the army and the sultans were drawn from their numbers.},

Alexandria was the main Mediterranean port and Fusṭāṭ was the capital city and the administrative and commercial centre. The survival of some Arabic-Christian historical works dealing with the Fāṭimid- Ayyūbid period adds significantly to Arabic-Muslim historiography. The period of Fāṭimid rule in Egypt can be divided into two distinctive phases: before and after the civil war of the 450s/1060s and the early 460s/1070s which also marked a transition from civilian to military rule. The Fāṭimid army of the sixth/twelfth century was a large force composed of cavalry and tens of thousands of black infantry and was scorned by the Franks for its poor fighting capabilities.},

Countless goods have been transported along the Eurasian trade routes. Spices, including especially pepper, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and mace, represent the most obvious examples. The rise of European commercial activities in the Indian Ocean appears to have actually spurred a corresponding increase in the overland caravan trade. In the first decades of the eighteenth century, the Mughal dynasty declined, and following Nadir Shah's invasion, the north Indian economy was under severe stress; however, economic growth was witnessed elsewhere, especially Iran. In 1750, new regional market was opened in the Russian city of Troitsk, at which prices were listed in both rubles and rupees.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that Ibn-Hawqal crossed the Sahara and visited Awdaghost in 951/2 to be the first Arab geographer who reached the gates of bilad al-Sudan. This is inferred from what he says about a cheque he saw in Awdaghost. A critical analysis of the references to this cheque suggests that it was a bill of debt owed by a trader from Sijilmasa resident at Awdaghost to another trader from Sijilmasa. The transactions between the two were part of the trans- Saharan trade, with one partner resident at Awdaghost and the other at Sijilmasa. The bill must have been held by the creditor, whom Ibn-Hawqal could have met at Sijilmasa. It was from this man that Ibn-Hawqal recorded the information about the ruler of the Sanhaja in the southern Sahara, and probably also about his relations with Ghana and other Sudanese polities. Another valuable piece of information, about the abandoned route from Ghana to Egypt, was collected in the oases of Egypt. Also, the detailed list of Berber tribes inhabiting the area between Tadmekka and Air could have been obtained in North Africa, rather than at Awdaghost, because communications in the Sahara were more frequent between north and south than between west and east. Ibn-Hawqal's description of the Sahara is stereotypic and adds nothing to what earlier geographers had to say, and the same applies to his words concerning Awdaghost itself. Towns and kingdoms in the Sudan mentioned by Ibn-Hawqal had already been recorded earlier by al-Ya'qubi, Ibn al-Faqih and al-Mas'udi. For a traveller who crossed the Sahara, Ibn-Hawqal's information is rather poor, but if he collected his information north of the Sahara, as this paper suggests, his labours as an inquisitive geographer are praiseworthy.},

  abstract = {The Bible's grand narrative about Israel's Exodus from Egypt is central to Biblical religion, Jewish, Christian, and Muslim identity and the formation of the academic disciplines studying the ancient Near East. It has also been a pervasive theme in artistic and popular imagination. Israel's Exodus in Transdisciplinary Perspective is a pioneering work surveying this tradition in unprecedented breadth, combining archaeological discovery, quantitative methodology and close literary reading. Archaeologists, Egyptologists, Biblical Scholars, Computer Scientists, Geoscientists and other experts contribute their diverse approaches in a novel, transdisciplinary consideration of ancient topography, Egyptian and Near Eastern parallels to the Exodus story, the historicity of the Exodus, the interface of the Exodus question with archaeological fieldwork on emergent Israel, the formation of biblical literature, and the cultural memory of the Exodus in ancient Israel and beyond.This edited volume contains research presented at the groundbreaking symposium "Out of Egypt: Israel’s Exodus Between Text and Memory, History and Imagination" held in 2013 at the Qualcomm Institute of the University of California, San Diego. The combination of 44 contributions by an international group of scholars from diverse disciplines makes this the first such transdisciplinary study of ancient text and history. In the original conference and with this new volume, revolutionary media, such as a 3D immersive virtual reality environment, impart innovative, Exodus-based research to a wider audience. Out of archaeology, ancient texts, science and technology emerge an up-to-date picture of the Exodus for the 21st Century and a new standard for collaborative research.},

Although much has been written about the status of non-Muslims in the Islamic empire, no previous works have examined how the rules applying to minorities were formulated. Milka Levy-Rubin's remarkable book traces the emergence of these regulations from the first surrender agreements in the immediate aftermath of conquest to the formation of the canonic document called the Pact of Ụmar, which was formalized under the early Ạbbasids, in the first half of the ninth century. What the study reveals is that the conquered peoples themselves played a major role in the creation of these policies, and that these were based on long-standing traditions, customs, and institutions from earlier pre-Islamic cultures that originated in the worlds of both the conquerors and the conquered. In its connections to Roman, Byzantine, and Sasanian traditions, the book will appeal to historians of Europe as well as Arabia and Persia"--Provided by publisher},

Drawing upon a range of under-explored primary sources, this article argues that the autobiography was never written as a traditional ex post facto memoir. Only by recognizing its fictionalized nature and by exploring the boundaries between biography and fiction, can al-Bannā’s memoirs can be properly understood.Keywords: Islamism, Egypt, Ḥasan al-Bannā, The Muslim Brothers, Biography, Autobiography},
